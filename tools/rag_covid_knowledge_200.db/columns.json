{"content": ["Title: Within host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in humans: Modeling immune responses and antiviral treatments\nContent: In December 2019, a newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus was emerged from China and propagated worldwide as a pandemic. In the absence of preventive medicine or a ready to use vaccine, mathematical models can provide useful scientific insights about transmission patterns and targets for drug development. In this study, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that blocking the production of the virus by infected cells decreases the viral load more than reducing the infection rate of healthy cells. Vaccination is also found useful but during the vaccine development phase, blocking virus production from infected cells can be targeted for antiviral drug development.", "Title: EcoSoft: Proposition of an Eco-Label for Software Sustainability\nContent: There is an increasing interest in corporate sustainability and how companies should include it to satisfy user’s requirements concerning social, economic, and environmental impacts. Research about sustainability in computer science aims to offer methods, techniques and tools to lessen the impact of new technologies on the environment, to offer a better world, a smarter life, to the next generations. Information systems must participate in the collective effort to move towards sustainable development, and software and application companies must lead a CSR strategy to achieve this aim. Moreover, beyond an individual company approach, sustainability should be seen as an integral quality of any software (as well as safety, performance or reliability). All of this seem obvious at a time when applications and programs of all kinds are ubiquitous in everyday life. Nevertheless, the challenges of sustainable development have still not been considered in certain key sectors such as the development of information technology. A lot of ecolabels exist for a lot of different products, although not for software sustainability. We propose in this work an ecolabel for software sustainability, based on a set of relevant criteria found in different works.", "Title: Estimating human-to-human transmissibility of hepatitis A virus in an outbreak at an elementary school in China, 2011\nContent: Hepatitis A is caused by hepatitis A virus and occurs worldwide. Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R(0), the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R(0). Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R(0). Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R(0) in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R(0) but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.", "Title: Developing an Ethics Framework for Allocating Remdesivir in the COVID-19 Pandemic\nContent: Abstract On May 1, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow use of the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Remdesivir is an investigational drug studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 and is available to children and pregnant women through compassionate use access, but is not yet FDA-approved. In early May, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began to distribute remdesivir donated by Gilead Sciences, Inc., to hospitals and state health departments for emergency use; multiple shipments have since been distributed. This process has raised questions of how remdesivir should be allocated. The Minnesota Department of Health has collaborated with the Minnesota COVID Ethics Collaborative and multiple clinical experts to issue an “Ethical Framework for May 2020 Allocation of Remdesivir in the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The framework builds on extensive ethical guidance developed for public health emergencies in Minnesota prior to the COVID-19 crisis. The Minnesota remdesivir allocation framework specifies an ethical approach to distributing the drug (1) to facilities across the state, and then (2) among COVID-19 patients within each facility. This article describes the process of developing the framework and adjustments in the framework over time with emergence of new data, analyzes key issues addressed, and suggests next steps. Sharing this framework and the development process can encourage transparency and may be useful to other states formulating and refining their approach to remdesivir EUA allocation.", "Title: Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public.\nContent: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the \"perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems\" association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Title: Grape juice increases the BDNF levels but not alter the S100B levels in hippocampus and frontal cortex from male Wistar Rats.\nContent: Several studies have shown that a high consumption of vegetables and fruits is consistently associated with a low risk of oxidative stress-induced diseases, which includes some degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson. Therefore, the objective of this study is to verify the effects of conventional and organic grape juice in the modulation of the neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and astrocytic markers protein (S100B) in hippocampus and frontal cortex of Wistar rats. In this study, 24 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. To the first one, it was given organic purple grape juice; to the second, conventional grape juice, while the last one received only saline. After 30 days, all rats were sacrificed and hippocampus and frontal cortex were dissected. The animals that received organic and conventional grape juice showed, in frontal cortex, an elevated BNDF levels in relation to saline group. However, S100B levels did not change. These results showed that grape juices are able to modulate important marker in brain tissue, and could be an important factor to prevent brain diseases.", "Title: Total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery: a preliminary evaluation in China.\nContent: BACKGROUND This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery without abdominal incision in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). METHODS From May 2010 to October 2011, 34 patients with colon and rectal tumors were treated by total laparoscopic surgery without abdominal incision, and the clinical data of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS All operations could be successfully accomplished without conversion to open surgery. No diverting ileostomy was created. The average operative time was 151.60 (range, 125-185) minutes. The average blood loss was 200.20 (range, 55-450) ml. All resection margins were negative. Six patients developed postoperative anastomotic leakage. There were no reports of other complications in all patients. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary study indicated that total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery in combination with TEM was a safe, feasible, and minimally invasive technique. This advanced surgical technique was developed by combining laparoscopy with the concept of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.", "Title: Single-incision laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection: technical aspects and potential benefits.\nContent: INTRODUCTION Our recent prospective randomized controlled trial (NCT01660048) comparing single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and multi-incision inguinal herniorraphy confirmed safety, efficacy and benefits of single-incision approach. This study (NCT01883115) aimed to assess safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. METHODS Patients with inguinal/femoral hernias from February 2013 to February 2014 undergoing SILTEP herniorraphy with telescopic dissection were compared with patients who had previously undergone SILTEP herniorraphy with balloon dissection. Costs of different ports/trocars were analysed. RESULTS There were 102 patients in telescopic compared to 51 in balloon dissection group; these had no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists and pre-op visual analogue scores. Telescopic vs. balloon showed: post-operative pain-day one 2.5 vs. 2.5; p = 0.90, day seven 0 vs. 0; p = 0.02 (0 vs. 1; p < 0.01 for bilateral hernias); operation times-unilateral 48.0 vs. 48.0 min; p = 0.88 and bilateral 70.0 vs. 65.0 min; p = 0.66, length of hospital stay 1.0 vs. 1.0 day, analgesic intake (dextropropoxyphene) 6.0 vs. 6.0 tablets; p = 0.95, return to work/normal physical activities 7.0 vs. 7.0 days; p = 0.46 and cosmetic scar scores 24.0 vs. 24.0, respectively. There was no conversion to open surgery/need for additional ports in either group. Median scar length for telescopic group was 13.0 mm. Costs of disposable ports/trocars for telescopic and balloon groups were US$480 and $720, respectively. There were no morbidities/recurrences with follow-up of 2-36 months. CONCLUSIONS Telescopic extraperitoneal dissection during SILTEP inguinal herniorraphy represents a safe and efficient alternative with potential cost savings compared to balloon dissection.", "Title: Association of classroom ventilation with reduced illness absence: a prospective study in California elementary schools\nContent: Limited evidence associates inadequate classroom ventilation rates (VRs) with increased illness absence (IA). We investigated relationships between VRs and IA in California elementary schools over two school years in 162 3rd–5th‐grade classrooms in 28 schools in three school districts: South Coast (SC), Bay Area (BA), and Central Valley (CV). We estimated relationships between daily IA and VR (estimated from two year daily real‐time carbon dioxide in each classroom) in zero‐inflated negative binomial models. We also compared IA benefits and energy costs of increased VRs. All school districts had median VRs below the 7.1 l/s‐person California standard. For each additional 1 l/s‐person of VR, IA was reduced significantly (p<0.05) in models for combined districts (−1.6%) and for SC (−1.2%), and nonsignificantly for districts providing less data: BA (−1.5%) and CV (−1.0%). Assuming associations were causal and generalizable, increasing classroom VRs from the California average (4 l/s‐person) to the State standard would decrease IA by 3.4%, increase attendance‐linked funding to schools by $33 million annually, and increase costs by only $4 million. Further increasing VRs would provide additional benefits. These findings, while requiring confirmation, suggest that increasing classroom VRs above the State standard would substantially decrease illness absence and produce economic benefits.", "Title: Mustelids\nContent: This chapter presents a synopsis of mustelid pathology. The depth of disease knowledge varies widely across species. It is greatest for mustelids with the strongest connections to humans (ferrets, mink, and otters). Similar conditions may occur in other mustelids, but have been missed due to limited examination by pathologists, providing ample opportunity for scientific discovery and improved clinical care. Globally mustelids are highly valued by humans as companions and commercial purposes, as the focus of conservation efforts, and as providers of beneficial ecosystem services, such as structuring their environment to optimize habitat for sympatric species. Although skunks and stink-badgers are no longer classified within the Mustelidae, they are included here for the sake of comparison and completeness. Members range from 25 g to 45 kg, occupy marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and exploit fully aquatic, arboreal, and fossorial lifestyles.", "Title: The Never‐ending Shift: A feminist reflection on living and organizing academic lives during the coronavirus pandemic\nContent: This article offers a feminist reflection written as a nocturnal stream of consciousness exposing the embodied, emotional and professional experience of living and working during a pandemic outbreak. Framed within a feminist approach, this personal narrative provides an example of the effects of such unexpected and unprecedented circumstances on personal and professional academic lives. Developed during the first stage of the (inter)national coronavirus pandemic, my reflections address issues of privilege; emotional labour; the virtual invasion of the home space within the current increasingly ambiguous space of ‘the workplace'; workload; and wellbeing. Further, I consider how the newly enforced flexible work measures based on online tools have turned current work–life dynamics into a ‘Never‐ending Shift'.", "Title: Suppression of NK cells and regulatory T lymphocytes in cats naturally infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus\nContent: Abstract A strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is thought to be indispensable for protection against infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats. In this study, the role of natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), central players in the innate and adaptive CMI respectively, was examined during natural FIPV infection. When quantified, both NK cells and Tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node (LN) and spleen in FIP cats. In contrast, mesentery and kidney from FIP cats did not show any difference when compared to healthy non-infected control animals. In addition, other regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+CD25−Foxp3+ and CD3+CD8+Foxp3+) were found to be depleted from blood and LN as well. Phenotypic analysis of blood-derived NK cells in FIP cats revealed an upregulation of activation markers (CD16 and CD25) and migration markers (CD11b and CD62L) while LN-derived NK cells showed upregulation of only CD16 and CD62L. LN-derived NK cells from FIPV-infected cats were also significantly less cytotoxic when compared with healthy cats. This study reveals for the first time that FIPV infection is associated with severe suppression of NK cells and Tregs, which is reflected by cell depletion and lowered cell functionality (only NK cells). This will un-doubtfully lead to a reduced capacity of the innate immune system (NK cells) to battle FIPV infection and a decreased capacity (Tregs) to suppress the immunopathology typical for FIP. However, these results will also open possibilities for new therapies targeting specifically NK cells and Tregs to enhance their numbers and/or functionality during FIPV infection.", "Title: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children: An update from Saudi Arabia\nContent: AIM: To summarize the reported Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cases, the associated clinical presentations and the outcomes. METHODS: We searched the Saudi Ministry of Health website, the World Health Organization website, and the Flutracker website. We also searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the keywords: Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, MERS-CoV in combination with pediatric, children, childhood, infancy and pregnancy from the initial discovery of the virus in 2012 to 2016. The retrieved articles were also read to further find other articles. Relevant data were placed into an excel sheet and analyzed accordingly. Descriptive analytic statistics were used in the final analysis as deemed necessary. RESULTS: From June 2012 to April 19, 2016, there were a total of 31 pediatric MERS-CoV cases. Of these cases 13 (42%) were asymptomatic and the male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The mean age of patients was 9.8 ± 5.4 years. Twenty-five (80.6%) of the cases were reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most common source of infection was household contact (10 of 15 with reported source) and 5 patients acquired infection within a health care facility. Using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of pediatric patients revealed that 9 out of 552 (1.6%) was positive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: Utilizing serology for MERS-CoV infection in Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not reveal any positive patients. Thus, the number of the pediatric MERS-CoV is low; the exact reason for the low prevalence of the disease in children is not known.", "Title: [Scenario-based study of medical resource requirement rapid assessment under the COVID-19 pandemic]\nContent: Objective: COVID-19 outbreak is still under global pandemic. China is facing the risks of importation and local rebound of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, preparations for medical resources are in urgently needed. Methods: Based on current understanding of the disease, we set up five scenarios and use the infectious disease transmission dynamic and pandemic theoretical static models to evaluate the demand for medical resources. Results: Different epidemic strength and strategies of disease control and prevention resulted in different levels of medical resource request, and active control strategy and effective measures could significantly decrease the requirement. During the epidemic rising phase, the cost of prevention and control measures and the requirement of professional response capacities would increase with potential high risk of medical resource demand sharply increasing. Conclusion: Regions with different economic level, population scale, and different prevention and control capabilities should all initiate scientific assessment of medical resource requirement under emergency response and prepare for possible future rebound and epidemic.", "Title: Vasculitides: F. Kawasaki’s Disease\nContent: Kawasaki’s disease (KD), once known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is a systemic inflammatory disorder occurring in children that is accompanied by vasculitis and a risk of coronary artery aneurysms. Other typical features of KD include spiking fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, erythematous changes on the lips and in the oral cavity, dryness and cracking of the lips, a strawberry appearance to the tongue, and a polymorphous rash. Eighty percent of KD cases occur in children less than 5 years of age. Attempts to link KD definitively to some types of infection, particularly ones associated with superantigens, have thus far been unsuccessful. High dose aspirin and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) are the cornerstones of therapy in KD. IVIG is essential to the prevention of coronary aneurysms. ■ Years after KD has occurred during childhood years, some cases of myocardial infarction caused by thrombosis of coronary aneurysms have been reported.", "Title: Meditsinskaya reabilitatsiya patsientov s pnevmoniyami, assotsiirovannymi s novoi koronavirusnoi infektsiei COVID-19./ [Medical rehabilitation of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection]\nContent: Effective medical rehabilitation of patients with pneumonia caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is critical for the recovery and optimization of emergency and specialty care outcomes. In this regard, it is relevant to develop a scientifically based medical rehabilitation program for patients with the coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19, whose composition and structure includes methods and tools that have proven effectiveness. AIM: To develop evidence-based approaches to medical rehabilitation for patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection. RESULTS: The clinical effects and suggested mechanisms of action of rehabilitation technologies in patients with pneumonia, including those associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection, are considered in Detail. The most studied of the physical methods that have a proven effect are physical exercises, breathing exercises, the complex effect of factors of resort therapy, hydrotherapy, which affect the main clinical manifestations of the underlying disease, astheno-neurotic syndrome and increasing immunity. Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation are proposed and its promising methods are considered. CONCLUSION: Regular generalization and analysis of high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate various physical methods of treatment of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection is Necessary, which serve as a basis for the development of future valid clinical recommendations. Timely and adequate specialized medical rehabilitation care is critical to maintaining the health, reducing disability and mortality of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection.", "Title: COVID-19 Outbreak, Social Response, and Early Economic Effects: A Global VAR Analysis of Cross-Country Interdependencies\nContent: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of countries' interconnections in understanding and reacting to the spread of the virus. This paper uses a global model with a sample of 41 countries to study the interdependencies between COVID-19 health shocks, populations' risk perceptions about the disease, and their social distancing responses; it also provides some early evidence about potential economic effects. Social networks are a central component in understanding the international transmission. We exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders, made available by Facebook, and show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease, but also cross-country spillovers in risk perceptions and in social behavior. Social distancing responses across countries are measured based on aggregated mobility tracking indicators, obtained from Google Mobility Reports. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which allows for endogeneity of each health, social, and economic, domestic variable, and for a dependence of domestic variables on country-specific foreign aggregates, which depend in turn on the matrix of social connections. Our empirical results highlight the importance of cross-country interdependencies and social networks. Risk perceptions and social responses are affected by experiences abroad, with Italy and the U.S. playing large roles in our sample. The social distancing responses to domestic health shocks are heterogeneous across countries, but they share some similarities: they adjust only gradually and with delay, hence displaying adaptive behavior. Early indicators are suggestive of unemployment consequences that vary widely across countries, depending on their labor market characteristics. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the U.S. and Spain, while the fluctuations are attenuated almost everywhere else.", "Title: Advances in Directly Amplifying Nucleic Acids from Complex Samples\nContent: Advances in nucleic acid amplification technologies have revolutionized diagnostics for systemic, inherited, and infectious diseases. Current assays and platforms, however, often require lengthy experimental procedures and multiple instruments to remove contaminants and inhibitors from clinically-relevant, complex samples. This requirement of sample preparation has been a bottleneck for using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) at the point of care (POC), though advances in “lab-on-chip” platforms that integrate sample preparation and NAATs have made great strides in this space. Alternatively, direct NAATs—techniques that minimize or even bypass sample preparation—present promising strategies for developing POC diagnostic tools for analyzing real-world samples. In this review, we discuss the current status of direct NAATs. Specifically, we surveyed potential testing systems published from 1989 to 2017, and analyzed their performances in terms of robustness, sensitivity, clinical relevance, and suitability for POC diagnostics. We introduce bubble plots to facilitate our analysis, as bubble plots enable effective visualization of the performances of these direct NAATs. Through our review, we hope to initiate an in-depth examination of direct NAATs and their potential for realizing POC diagnostics, and ultimately transformative technologies that can further enhance healthcare.", "Title: Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance of Three Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays for the Detection of IgG Antibodies to Ebola Virus in Human Sera\nContent: Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.", "Title: Selective and Dual Targeting of CCR2 and CCR5 Receptors: A Current Overview\nContent: The chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) are important mediators of leukocyte trafficking in inflammatory processes. The emerging evidence for a role of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors in human inflammatory diseases led to a growing interest in CCR2- and CCR5-selective antagonists. In this review, we focus on the recent development of selective CCR2/CCR5 receptor ligands and dual antagonists. Several compounds targeting CCR2, e.g., INCB8761 and MK0812, were developed as promising candidates for clinical trials, but failed to show clinical efficacy as presumed from preclinical models. The role of CCR5 receptors as the second co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion led to the development of various CCR5-selective ligands. Maraviroc is the first CCR5-targeting drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infections on the market. The role of CCR5 receptors in the progression of inflammatory processes fueled the use of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, the use of maraviroc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to its inefficacy. Some of the ligands, e.g., TAK-779 and TAK-652, were also found to be dual antagonists of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. The fact that CCR2 and CCR5 receptor antagonists contribute to the treatment of inflammatory diseases renders the development of dual antagonists as promising novel therapeutic strategy.", "Title: Deformation imaging to assess global and regional effects of cardiac regenerative therapy in ischemic heart disease - a systematic review.\nContent: BACKGROUND Currently, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most common endpoint in cardiovascular stem cell therapy research. However, this global measure of cardiac function might not be suitable to detect the regional effects sorted by this therapy, and is hampered by high operator variability and loading dependency. Deformation imaging might be more accurate in detecting potential regional functional improvements by cardiac regenerative therapy. OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current literature on the value of deformation imaging in cardiac regenerative therapy. METHODS A systematic review of current literature available on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases was performed regarding both animal- and patient studies in which deformation imaging was used to study cardiac cell therapy. After critical appraisal, outcomes regarding study design, type of cell therapy, procedural characteristics, outcome measure, method for measuring strain and efficacy on both LVEF and deformation parameters were depicted. RESULTS A total of 30 studies, 15 preclinical and 15 clinical, were included for analysis. Deformation outcomes improved significantly in 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and in 10 out of 15 clinical studies, whilst LVEF improved in 12 and 4 articles respectively. Study designs and used deformation outcomes varied significantly among the included papers. CONCLUSION 6 studies found a positive effect on deformation outcomes without LVEF improvement. Hence, deformation imaging seems at least equal, and perhaps superior, to LVEF measurement in the assessment of cardiac regenerative therapy. However, strategies varied substantially and call for a standardized approach.", "Title: A culturally-competent approach to emergency management: What lessons can we learn from the COVID-19?\nContent: The COVID-19 pandemic, like other disasters, is exposing and exacerbating social, economic, and health care inequalities. Although the ethical and clinical imperative of providing culturally-competent health care has long been recognized, the influence of culturally-competent interventions within emergency management has not been systematically examined. This paper discusses several culturally-competent strategies that were taken by the Israeli national and local authorities in high-risk areas and communities during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to controlling the pandemic outbreak, such an approach has the potential to reduce social disparities in health care, promote community resilience, and facilitate social cohesion.

These viruses show marked species specificity in receptor utilization as they can only use APN of their respective species to initiate virus infection. Feline and canine coronaviruses are also group I coronaviruses. To determine whether feline APN could serve as a receptor for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), we cloned the cDNA encoding feline APN (fAPN) by PCR from feline cells and stably expressed it in FCoV-resistant mouse or hamster cells. These became susceptible to infection with either of several biotypes of FCoVs. The expression of recombinant fAPN also made hamster and mouse cells susceptible to infection with other group I coronaviruses, including several canine coronavirus strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus HCV-229E. Thus, fAPN served as a functional receptor for each of these coronaviruses in group I. As expected, fAPN could not serve as a receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a group II coronavirus which uses murine biliary glycoproteins as receptors. Thus, fAPN acts as a common receptor for coronaviruses in group I, in marked contrast to human and porcine APN glycoproteins which serve as receptors only for human and porcine coronaviruses, respectively. These observations suggest that cats could serve as a \"mixing vessel\" in which simultaneous infection with several group I coronaviruses could lead to recombination of viral genomes.", "Title: The sensitivity and specificity analyses of ambient temperature and population size on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in different provinces of Iran\nContent: On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases. Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.", "Title: Oligonucleotide Functionalised Microbeads: Indispensable Tools for High-Throughput Aptamer Selection\nContent: The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols. In addition to simplifying the separation of binding and non-binding aptamer candidates, microbeads have facilitated the integration of other technologies such as emulsion PCR (ePCR) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to high-throughput selection techniques. Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Within this review we explore examples and applications of oligonucleotide functionalised microbeads in aptamer selection and reflect upon new opportunities arising for aptamer science.", "Title: Spacematch: Using environmental preferences to match occupants to suitable activity-based workspaces\nContent: The activity-based workspace (ABW) paradigm is becoming more popular in commercial office spaces. In this strategy, occupants are given a choice of spaces to do their work and personal activities on a day-to-day basis. This paper shows the implementation and testing of the Spacematch platform that was designed to improve the allocation and management of ABW. An experiment was implemented to test the ability to characterize the preferences of occupants to match them with suitable environmentally-comfortable and spatially-efficient flexible workspaces. This approach connects occupants with a catalog of available work desks using a web-based mobile application and enables them to provide real-time environmental feedback. In this work, we tested the ability for this feedback data to be merged with indoor environmental values from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors to optimize space and energy use by grouping occupants with similar preferences. This paper outlines a case study implementation of this platform on two office buildings. This deployment collected 1,182 responses from 25 field-based research participants over a 30-day study. From this initial data set, the results show that the ABW occupants can be segmented into specific types of users based on their accumulated preference data, and matching preferences can be derived to build a recommendation platform.", "Title: Intra-caval Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation for a Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) Metastasis in Transplanted Liver.\nContent: Less than 1% of patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are susceptible to liver transplantation. We report a case of a patient transplanted 13 years ago for NET metastases, with a lesion histologically proved for NET metastasis located at the cava vein anastomosis. He was treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) after a first failed attempt of endovascular approach. The vascular heat sink, which RFA is susceptible to, was considered an advantage in this case, since it restricted the propagation of heat only to the tissue located in the very proximity of the RFA antenna, protecting the inferior vena cava vessel walls. This positive result may suggest an additional use of RFA in selected challenging cases.", "Title: Specificity switching in virus–receptor complexes\nContent: Several structures of complexes between viral attachment proteins and their cellular receptors have been determined recently, enhancing our understanding of the molecular recognition processes that guide formation of virus–receptor complexes. Moreover, these structures also highlight strategies by which highly similar viral proteins within a single virus family can adapt to engage different receptors. Consequences of such differences are altered tropism and pathogenicity. An improved understanding of the molecular details of this specificity switching in receptor binding will help to establish links between receptor tropism, spread, and disease. Moreover, it also has relevance for the design and use of viruses as gene delivery vehicles with altered properties as well as for the identification of target viral epitopes of new vaccines.", "Title: In and Beyond COVID-19: US Academic Pharmaceutical Science and Engineering Community Must Engage to Meet Critical National Needs\nContent: The supply of affordable, high-quality pharmaceuticals to US patients has been on a critical path for decades. In and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, this critical path has become tortuous. To regain reliability, reshoring of the pharmaceutical supply chain to the USA is now a vital national security need. Reshoring the pharmaceutical supply with old know-how and outdated technologies that cause inherent unpredictability and adverse environmental impact will neither provide the security we seek nor will it be competitive and affordable. The challenge at hand is complex akin to redesigning systems, including corporate and public research and development, manufacturing, regulatory, and education ones. The US academic community must be engaged in progressing solutions needed to counter emergencies in the COVID-19 pandemic and in building new methods to reshore the pharmaceutical supply chain beyond the pandemic.", "Title: Identification of dispensable nucleotide sequence in 3′ untranslated region of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus\nContent: Abstract The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of porcine arterivirus genome plays a pivotal role for virus replication, yet the properties of 3′ UTR remain largely undefined. We conducted site-directed mutagenesis to the 3′ UTR of the type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Serial deletions of the 3′ UTR showed that at least 40 nucleotides immediately following the ORF7 stop codon were dispensable for the viability of PRRSV in cultured cells. We then constructed a chimeric PRRSV cDNA clone using type II PRRSV as the backbone containing the 3′ UTR from the type I PRRSV. The chimeric virus was viable and shared similar properties with the parental virus. Our results provided the first description of the 40nt dispensable region in type I PRRSV 3′ UTR, and further predicted structure demonstrated that the high-order structure of 3′ UTR might play significant roles in its function.", "Title: The voltage-gated proton channel hHv1 is functionally expressed in human chorion-derived mesenchymal stem cells\nContent: The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is widely expressed, among others, in immune and cancer cells, it provides an efficient cytosolic H+extrusion mechanism and regulates vital functions such as oxidative burst, migration and proliferation. Here we demonstrate the presence of human Hv1 (hHv1) in the placenta/chorion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) using RT-PCR. The voltage- and pH-dependent gating of the current is similar to that of hHv1 expressed in cell lines and that the current is blocked by 5-chloro-2-guanidinobenzimidazole (ClGBI) and activated by arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibition of hHv1 by ClGBI significantly decreases mineral matrix production of cMSCs induced by conditions mimicking physiological or pathological (inorganic phosphate, Pi) induction of osteogenesis. Wound healing assay and single cell motility analysis show that ClGBI significantly inhibits the migration of cMSCs. Thus, seminal functions of cMSCs are modulated by hHv1 which makes this channel as an attractive target for controlling advantages/disadvantages of MSCs therapy.", "Title: Quantitative COVID-19 infectiousness estimate correlating with viral shedding and culturability suggests 68% pre-symptomatic transmissions\nContent: A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days before and after the onset of symptoms. At the epidemiological level, this information on how infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter. In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (rho=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability (rho=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.", "Title: A comprehensive guide to perioperative management and operative technique for robotic cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion.\nContent: Robotic-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) represents an evolution of open radical cystectomy (ORC) with the aim of reducing patient morbidity and improving return to normal function, whilst maintaining oncological equivalence. RARC is gaining popularity, especially in high-volume centres, although there remains a lack of level 1 evidence to demonstrate any superiority of RARC over ORC. All previously reported studies that randomised ORC and RARC have utilised a technique for RARC requiring a conversion to open surgery for urinary diversion. Conversion to open surgery invariably masks the benefits of a truly minimally invasive approach. Moreover, such studies tend to report a small sample size, likely reflecting early surgical experience that may contribute to the lack of observed benefit. Nonetheless, it is established that short-term oncological outcomes following RARC are comparable to those after ORC. It is likely that the benefits of RARC are only observed in cases wherein intracorporeal urinary diversion (iRARC) is performed by a surgical team with high volume experience, which will minimise morbidity and maximise early return to normal function. In this review, we will discuss a holistic approach to iRARC, including patient selection, perioperative optimisation, the surgical technique for iRARC with urinary diversion reconstruction, the use of enhanced recovery protocol, oncological outcomes and perioperative complications.", "Title: Translational frameshifting in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene in vitro.\nContent: Production of the gamma subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is dependent on a very efficient translational frameshif in the dnaX gene. I used an E. coli in vitro translation system to analyze the mechanism of this frameshifting event. In this system, gamma was produced almost to the same extent as the inframe translation product, tau, suggesting that efficient frameshifting was reproduced in vitro. Coupling with transcription was not necessary for frameshifting. Addition of purified tau or gamma had no effect on the frameshifting process suggesting the absence of direct feedback regulation. By use of mutant genes, a strong pausing site was identified at or very close to the frameshift site. This pausing was apparently caused by a potential stem-loop structure which was previously shown to enhance frameshifting. Thus, enhancement of frameshifting by this putative stem-loop seems to be mediated by the translation pausing at the frameshift site. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the dnaX frameshift site to that of the eukaryotic retroviral genes, dnaX mRNA synthesized in vitro failed to direct the production of gamma in eukaryotic translation systems. This suggests that frameshifting in the dnaX gene depends on components specific to the E. coli translation system.", "Title: Adaptive Influence Maximization: If Influential Node Unwilling to Be the Seed\nContent: Influence maximization problem attempts to find a small subset of nodes that makes the expected influence spread maximized, which has been researched intensively before. They all assumed that each user in the seed set we select is activated successfully and then spread the influence. However, in the real scenario, not all users in the seed set are willing to be an influencer. Based on that, we consider each user associated with a probability with which we can activate her as a seed, and we can attempt to activate her many times. In this paper, we study the adaptive influence maximization with multiple activations (Adaptive-IMMA) problem, where we select a node at each step, observe whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the influence diffusion process; If no, we can attempt to activate her again with higher cost, or select other node as a seed. We model the multiple activations mathematically, and define it on the domain of integer lattice. We propose a new concept, adaptive DR-submodularity, and show our Adaptive-IMMA is the problem that maximizing an adaptive monotone and DR-submodular function under the knapsack constraint. Adaptive DR-submodular maximization problem is never covered by any existing studies. Thus, we summarize its properties and study its approximability comprehensively, which is a non-trival generalization of existing analysis about adaptive submodularity. Besides, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the influence spread, we combine adaptive greedy policy with sampling techniques without losing approximation ratio but reducing the time complexity. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.", "Title: Emergency revascularization of acute internal carotid artery occlusion: Follow the spike, it guides you.\nContent: The present study sought to examine the incidence of the angiographic \"spike sign\" and to assess its predictive significance for achieving carotid revascularization in 54 patients with acute internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions that required urgent endovascular revascularization. Clinical and imaging files of consecutive patients with ICA occlusion who were treated in a tertiary care academic medical center from 2011-2015 were retrospectively examined under Institutional Review Board approval with a waiver of the requirement for informed consent. All proximal ICA occlusions were treated by stent-assisted carotid angioplasty, and all distal embolic occlusions were managed with stent-assisted mechanical thrombectomy. The study included 24 patients with acute ICA occlusion (group 1) and 30 patients with tandem ICA-intracranial occlusions (group 2). The spike sign was seen in 16/24 patients in group 1 (67%), and successful ICA revascularization was achieved in 14/16 (88%). The sign was seen in 26/30 patients in group 2 (87%), and ICA revascularization was successful in all 26 (100%). The remaining 12 patients had no spike sign, and ICA revascularization was successful in only 7/12 (58%). The spike sign is a transient finding that represents the proximal patent remnant of the stenotic corridor in fresh clot. Acute ICA occlusion frequently leaves the spike sign as a marker of the recent thrombotic event. The spike vertex points to the \"path of least resistance\" for the guidewire to cross the occlusion and engage the true arterial lumen, a critical step during ICA endovascular revascularization.", "Title: Absence of antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cells\nContent: Abstract Cats infected with virulent feline coronavirus which causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) usually succumb to disease despite high antibody concentrations. One of the mechanisms that can help resolving infection is antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) of infected cells. ADCML consists of virus-specific antibodies that bind to cell surface expressed viral proteins which result in complement activation and cell lysis. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of FIP-virus (FIPV) infected cells towards ADCML and to examine the role of the accessory proteins 3abc and 7ab in this process. ADCML assays, using FIPV strain 79-1146 and its deletion mutant strain Δ3abc/Δ7ab, were performed on: (i) CrFK cells that show surface-expressed viral antigens, (ii) monocytes without surface-expressed viral proteins due to retention and (iii) monocytes with surface-expressed viral proteins since the antibody-mediated internalization of these proteins was blocked. As expected, no ADCML was detected of the monocytes without surface-expressed viral antigens. Surprisingly, no lysis was observed in the CrFK cells and the monocytes that do show surface-expressed viral proteins, while controls showed that the ADCML assay was functional. These experiments proof that FIPV can employ another immune evasion strategy against ADCML (besides preventing surface expression): the inhibition of complement-mediated lysis. This new evasion strategy is not attributed to the group-specific proteins since lysis of cells infected with FIPV Δ3abc/Δ7ab was not detected.", "Title: Variation in False-Negative Rate of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction–Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure\nContent: BACKGROUND: Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to “rule out” infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. DESIGN: Literature review and pooled analysis. SETTING: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). PATIENTS: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. RESULTS: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%) on day 1 to 67% (CI, 27% to 94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (CI, 18% to 65%). This decreased to 20% (CI, 12% to 30%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21% (CI, 13% to 31%) on day 9 to 66% (CI, 54% to 77%) on day 21. LIMITATION: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection—particularly early in the course of infection—when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins Health System, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "Title: Proteasome-Dependent Disruption of the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex by HCMV Protein pUL21a\nContent: The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which controls ubiquitination and degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins. During infection, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen, not only phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1 via the multifunctional viral kinase pUL97, it also promotes degradation of APC subunits via an unknown mechanism. Using a proteomics approach, we found that a recently identified HCMV protein, pUL21a, interacted with the APC. Importantly, we determined that expression of pUL21a was necessary and sufficient for proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4 and APC5. This resulted in APC disruption and required pUL21a binding to the APC. We have identified the proline-arginine amino acid pair at residues 109–110 in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A point mutant virus in which proline-arginine were mutated to alanines (PR-AA) grew at wild-type levels. However, a double mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC was abrogated by both PR-AA point mutation and UL97 deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the UL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that these mutations are synthetically lethal, and that HCMV exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the APC to overcome its restriction on virus infection. This study reveals the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and uncovers a unique viral mechanism to subvert APC activity.", "Title: The pathogenesis and treatment of the `Cytokine Storm' in COVID-19\nContent: Summary Cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli. The pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex. The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high. Certain evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the cytokine storm in their bodies. This article reviews the occurrence mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment.", "Title: Rooting Trees, Methods for\nContent: Abstract Identifying the root of a phylogenetic tree is important because incorrectly rooted phylogenetic trees may mislead evolutionary and taxonomic inferences. Many techniques for inferring the root have been proposed, but each has shortcomings that may make it inappropriate for any particular dataset. Here we outline the various ways to root phylogenetic trees, which include: outgroup, midpoint rooting, molecular clock rooting, and Bayesian molecular clock rooting. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons and also list software availability for each of the rooting methods.", "Title: Empowering patients in decision making in radiation oncology - can we do better?\nContent: The decision as to whether or not a patient should receive radiation therapy as part of their cancer treatment is based on evidence-based practice and on recommended international consensus treatment guidelines. However, the merit of involving the patients' individual preferences and values in the treatment decision is frequently overlooked. Here, we review the current literature pertaining to shared decision making in the field of radiation oncology, including discussion of the patient's perception of radiation therapy as a treatment option and patient involvement in clinical trials. The merit of decision aids during the shared decision making process in radiation oncology is considered, as are patient preferences for active or passive involvement in decisions about their treatment. Clarity of terminology, a better understanding of effective strategies and increased resources will be needed to ensure shared decision making in radiation oncology becomes a reality.", "Title: Viroporin Activity of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Non-Structural 2B Protein\nContent: Viroporins are a family of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic transmembrane proteins that are encoded by various animal viruses. Viroporins form transmembrane pores in host cells via oligomerization, thereby destroying cellular homeostasis and inducing cytopathy for virus replication and virion release. Among the Picornaviridae family of viruses, the 2B protein encoded by enteroviruses is well understood, whereas the viroporin activity of the 2B protein encoded by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has not yet been described. An analysis of the FMDV 2B protein domains by computer-aided programs conducted in this study revealed that this protein may contain two transmembrane regions. Further biochemical, biophysical and functional studies revealed that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells. The protein was found to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with both the N- and C-terminal domains stretched into the cytosol. It exhibited cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, which attenuated 2B protein expression. The release of virions from cells infected with FMDV was inhibited by amantadine, a viroporin inhibitor. The 2B protein monomers interacted with each other to form both intracellular and extracellular oligomers. The Ca(2+) concentration in the cells increased, and the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was disrupted in cells that expressed the 2B protein. Moreover, the 2B protein induced intense autophagy in host cells. All of the results of this study demonstrate that the FMDV 2B protein has properties that are also found in other viroporins and may be involved in the infection mechanism of FMDV.", "Title: Knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in a low-resource African setting\nContent: Background: Coronavirus disease pandemic has resulted in death of thousands of people across several countries. Several preventive measures have been recommended to halt the spread of the disease and its associated mortality. However, the level knowledge and practice of these preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, which constitute vulnerable groups, are yet to be evaluated. Aim: To determine the knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in Abakaliki. Materials and Methods: This was a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 among 284 antenatal clinic attendees at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. A pretested and validated questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results: Of 284 participants, 60.9% (n=173) had adequate knowledge of the preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. However, the overall practice of these preventive measures among the participants were poor as 69.7% of the participants were not practicing the preventive measures against the coronavirus. The determinants of poor practice of the preventive measures among the participants were being in age group 31-40 years (AOR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.26 - 5.37, p=0.022), married (AOR=2.99, 95%CI: 1.40 - 6.33, p=0.035) grandmultiparous (AOR=3.11, 95%CI: 1.32 - 6.56, p=0.021), residing in rural area (AOR=2.08, 95%CI: 1.32 - 4.05, p=0.031), and having no formal education (AOR=6.73, 95%CI: 2.66 - 18.34, p=0.002). Conclusion: The study showed that most of the participants had adequate knowledge of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection but the practice of these preventive measures were poor among the participants.", "Title: Caval-aortic access to allow transcatheter aortic valve replacement in otherwise ineligible patients: initial human experience.\nContent: OBJECTIVES This study describes the first use of caval-aortic access and closure to enable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients who lacked other access options. Caval-aortic access refers to percutaneous entry into the abdominal aorta from the femoral vein through the adjoining inferior vena cava. BACKGROUND TAVR is attractive in high-risk or inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis. Available transcatheter valves require large introducer sheaths, which are a risk for major vascular complications or preclude TAVR altogether. Caval-aortic access has been successful in animals. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective review of procedural and 30-day outcomes of prohibitive-risk patients who underwent TAVR via caval-aortic access. RESULTS Between July 2013 and January 2014, 19 patients underwent TAVR via caval-aortic access; 79% were women. Caval-aortic access and tract closure were successful in all 19 patients; TAVR was successful in 17 patients. Six patients experienced modified VARC-2 major vascular complications, 2 (11%) of whom required intervention. Most (79%) required blood transfusion. There were no deaths attributable to caval-aortic access. Throughout the 111 (range 39 to 229) days of follow up, there were no post-discharge complications related to tract creation or closure. All patients had persistent aorto-caval flow immediately post-procedure. Of the 16 patients who underwent repeat imaging after the first week, 15 (94%) had complete closure of the residual aorto-caval tract. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous transcaval venous access to the aorta allows TAVR in otherwise ineligible patients, and may offer a new access strategy for other applications requiring large transcatheter implants.", "Title: Transorbital Cavernous Sinus Direct Puncture : Alternative to treat dural arteriovenous fistula.\nContent: INTRODUCTION The authors present a retrospective series of their clinical experience in the treatment of cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) by direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus as an alternative to the endovascular approach. METHODS Between October 2012 and September 2014, eight patients harboring cavernous DAVF underwent percutaneous treatment by direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus at three institutions. All patients presented with ocular symptoms. Standard endovascular approaches, including transvenous and transarterial routes, were primarily attempted without success in all cases. Direct puncture was performed through two different approaches, namely inferolateral and superomedial. The entry point was the inferior and superior eyelid, respectively. Embolization was performed with coils or Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, CA). Immediate and late angiographies were used to evaluate the occlusion of the fistula. RESULTS Of the patients seven had complete occlusion of the cavernous DAVFs noted on the immediate and follow-up angiograms and one patient had residual filling but reduction of the shunt resulted in clinical improvement. None of the patients had worsening of neurological function. One case was complicated by inadvertent internal carotid puncture but without clinical manifestations. One patient experienced postoperative superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis. CONCLUSION In very specific cases, when endovascular access is not possible or fails to occlude cavernous DAVF, direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus was shown to be feasible, safe and very effective.", "Title: Hyper-vascular giant cavernous malformation in a child: a case report and review.\nContent: INTRODUCTION Giant cavernous malformation (GCM) in children is a rare vascular anomaly, and its natural history is unclear. Despite their giant size, intraparenchymal GCMs are low-flow vascular malformations. Herein, we report a case of hyper-vascular intraparenchymal GCM with an AV shunt in a child. CASE A 3-year-old boy had had an enlarged head since infancy. Magnetic resonance (MR) images on admission showed a strikingly enhanced mass lesion, 6 cm in size. A 4-vessel CAG demonstrated a hyper-vascular mass with an AV shunt. After transarterial embolization, the patient underwent total excision of the mass. The tumor bled easily, during surgery the patient lost 400 cm3 in blood. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. CONCLUSION The differential diagnosis of intraparenchymal, strikingly-enhanced tumors with an AV shunt include hyper-vascular GCMs. Consideration of potential for bleeding during the operation is also important.", "Title: Pig epidemic diarrhoea virus S gene variant with a large deletion non-lethal to colostrum-deprived newborn piglets.\nContent: We previously identified a third porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) S variant with a large deletion of 582 nucleotides in the 5' terminal region of the S gene, in addition to the North American type and the S INDELs type. To investigate the pathogenicity of this variant, TTR-2/JPN/2014, we performed experimental infection using colostrum-deprived piglets and compared the results with those from the North American type PEDV, OKN-1/JPN/2013. Fifteen newborn piglets were divided into two groups of 7-8 piglets each and inoculated orally with one of PEDV isolates maintained at the eighth passage in Vero cell culture. Although all PEDV-inoculated piglets showed acute watery diarrhoea, lethality clearly differed between both PEDV-inoculated groups. Moreover, there were differences in virus distribution and lesions on the intestines between the two PEDV-inoculated groups. Therefore, our data suggest that the OKN-1/JPN/2013 PEDV isolate is virulent, whereas the TTR-2/JPN/2014 PEDV isolate is avirulent.", "Title: Retrospective Multicenter Study of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prophylaxis in Korean Children with Congenital Heart Diseases\nContent: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of current data on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis with palivizumab, in Korean children with congenital heart diseases (CHD). In 2009, the Korean guideline for RSV prophylaxis had established up to five shots monthly per RSV season, only for children <1 year of age with hemodynamic significance CHD (HS-CHD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During the RSV seasons in 2009-2015, we performed a retrospective review of data for 466 infants with CHD, examined at six centers in Korea. RESULTS: Infants received an average of 3.7±1.9 (range, 1-10) injections during the RSV season. Fifty-seven HS-CHD patients (12.2%) were hospitalized with breakthrough RSV bronchiolitis, with a recurrence in three patients, one year after the initial check-up. Among patients with simple CHD, only five (1.1%) patients received one additional dose postoperatively, as per the limitations set by the Korean guideline. Among the 30 deaths (6.4%), five (1.1%) were attributed to RSV infection; three to simple CHD, one to Tetralogy of Fallot, and one to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Of the three HCM patients that exceeded guidelines for RSV prophylaxis, two (66.6%) were hospitalized, and one died of RSV infection (33.3%). CONCLUSION: In accordance to the Korean guideline, minimal injections of palivizumab were administered to patients having HS-CHD <one year of age during the RSV season; the risk of RSV infection remains significant among children with simple CHD, cardiomyopathy, and children above the age of one year with HS-CHD.", "Title: Antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type-2\nContent: BACKGROUND: Dengue is a major mosquito-borne disease currently with no effective antiviral or vaccine available. Effort to find antivirals for it has focused on bioflavonoids, a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits. In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated. Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC(50)) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC(50)) for each compound. RESULTS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 μg mL(-1 )when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells. The IC(50 )decreased to 28.9 μg mL(-1 )when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection. The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 μg mL(-1), respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied. Naringin only exhibited anti-adsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC(50 )= 168.2 μg mL(-1 )and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC(50 )= 142.6 μg mL(-1 )when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption. The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays. Quercetin and daidzein (50 μg mL(-1)) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin. CONCLUSION: Results from the study suggest that only quercetin demonstrated significant anti-DENV-2 inhibitory activities. Other bioflavonoids, including daidzein, naringin and hesperetin showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication. These findings, together with those previously reported suggest that select group of bioflavonoids including quercetin and fisetin, exhibited significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus. This group of flavonoids, flavonol, could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication.", "Title: Acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19.\nContent: Ischemic stroke may be a presenting feature of COVID-19. Its etiology remains unclear, but severe COVID-19 disease might increase the risk of large-artery strokes. More evidence is needed to substantiate the current reports and provide insights for optimal management.", "Title: Asthma comes in from the cold\nContent: Infection with viruses, such as those responsible for the common cold, may be linked to exacerbation of asthma. As the link becomes clearer, it may provide pharmaceutical companies with a new target for developing anti-asthma drugs. At the joint 15th International Congress of Allergology and Clinical Immunology and the Annual Meeting of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology [ Stockholm, Sweden; June/July 1994 ], Professor Stephen Holgate from Southampton, UK, described how his group has used an elegant combination of epidemiology, clinical medicine and in vitro immunohistochemistry to investigate this relationship.", "Title: Historical Aspects of Polyclonal IgG Preparations\nContent: Today we can choose between several polyclonal IgG products for both replacement and immunomodulation. However, it was a long way to go to reach this stage. In this chapter, we try to illustrate the major stages of IgG product development which began more than 70 years ago.", "Title: Subcellular localization and rearrangement of endoplasmic reticulum by Brome mosaic virus capsid protein.\nContent: Genome packaging in the plant-infecting Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member of the alphavirus-like superfamily, as well as in other positive-strand RNA viruses pathogenic to humans (e.g., poliovirus) and animals (e.g., Flock House virus), is functionally coupled to replication. Although the subcellular localization site of BMV replication has been identified, that of the capsid protein (CP) has remained elusive. In this study, the application of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to Nicotiana benthamiana leaves expressing replication-derived BMV CP as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion, in conjunction with antibodies to the CP and double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, revealed that the subcellular localization sites of replication and CP overlap. Our temporal analysis by transmission electron microscopy of ultrastructural modifications induced in BMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves revealed a reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) incorporating large assemblies of vesicles derived from ER accumulated in the cytoplasm during BMV infection. Additionally, for the first time, we have found by ectopic expression experiments that BMV CP itself has the intrinsic property of modifying ER to induce vesicles similar to those present in BMV infections. The significance of CP-induced vesicles in relation to CP-organized viral functions that are linked to replication-coupled packaging is discussed.", "Title: Kardiologie\nContent: Die Kardiologie ist ein wichtiges und sehr umfangreiches Themengebiet der Inneren Medizin. In diesem Kapitel werden die wichtigsten Pathologien, die sich am Herzen manifestieren können, ihre Diagnostik und Therapie dargestellt. Hierzu zählen vor allem Erkrankungen des Endokards, Herzklappenfehler (erworben wie angeboren), Herzrhythmusstörungen, aber auch Erkrankungen des Myo- und Perikards. Ebenso werden die Herzinsuffizienz und die koronare Herzkrankheit (KHK) in einem eigenen Abschnitt behandelt. Am Ende des Kapitels wird kurz auf die seltenen Tumoren am Herzen und funktionelle Herzbeschwerden eingegangen.", "Title: Biennial spring activity of human metapneumovirus in Austria.\nContent: BACKGROUND Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is considered an important respiratory pathogen in young children. To gain insight into the seasonality and epidemiologic characteristics of HMPV infection, this study determined the frequency of HMPV infections in hospitalized infants during a 7-year period. METHODS By use of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 1612 infants less than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute respiratory tract illness were tested for the presence of HMPV. Weekly HMPV testing data were analyzed to assess the timing of HMPV activity. Season variability was estimated by comparing the onset, duration, peak, and end of outbreaks from October 2000 through October 2007. RESULTS Overall, 109 (6.8%) of 1612 cases of acute respiratory illness were associated with HMPV infection. Seasonal HMPV activity varied substantially from year to year, both in prevalence rates of HMPV cases and in seasonal timing of outbreaks. HMPV activity was characterized by a biennial rhythm, with spring seasons occurring every second year, and these accounted for a substantial proportion, up to 30%, of hospitalized cases of acute respiratory tract illness. CONCLUSIONS HMPV activity varies substantially from year to year, both in the frequency and timing of illness and shows a biennial pattern of alternating winter and spring activity.", "Title: Deep throat saliva as an alternative diagnostic specimen type for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2\nContent: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are widely accepted as specimens for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. However, the collection procedures for NPS specimens causes sneezing and coughing in most patients, which generate droplets or aerosol particles that are hazardous to the healthcare workers collecting these specimens. In this study, 95 patient‐matched paired deep throat saliva (DTS) and NPS specimens from 62 patients were analyzed. Samples were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 by reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). The rates of detection for DTS (53.7%) and NPS (47.4%) samples were comparable (P = .13). It is important to note that the patients should be clearly instructed or supervised during DTS collection. In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 detection by RT‐PCR was equivalent in DTS and NPS specimens.", "Title: Assessment of dyssynchrony by gated myocardial perfusion imaging does not improve patient management.\nContent: Clinical trials have demonstrated improved outcomes with cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with heart failure and electrical evidence of dyssynchrony. There has been intense effort at developing imaging markers of dyssynchrony with the aim of improved risk stratification. However, these efforts have not been fruitful to date. This article discusses mechanisms of cardiac dyssynchrony, reviews clinical data supporting resynchronization therapy, and addresses the lack of convincing evidence to support the use of noninvasive imaging measures of dyssynchrony in improving patient management.", "Title: The role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in Immune Regulation and Diseases\nContent: Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are derivatives of the heterocyclic aromatic compound quinoline. These economical compounds were used as antimalarial agents for many years. Currently, they are used as monotherapy or in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Based on its effects on the modulation of the autophagy process, various clinical studies suggest that CQ and HCQ could be used in combination with other chemotherapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer. Furthermore, the antiviral effects showed against Zika, Chikungunya, and HIV are due to the annulation of endosomal/lysosomal acidification. Recently, CQ and HCQ were approved for The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of infected patients with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease originated in December 2019, namely COVID-2019. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pharmacological effects of these drugs: 1) disruption of lysosomal and endosomal pH, 2) inhibition of protein secretion/expression, 3) inhibition of antigen presentation, 4) decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, 5) inhibition of autophagy, 6) induction of apoptosis and 7) inhibition of ion channels activation. Thus, evidence has shown that these structures are leader molecules that can be modified or combined with other therapeutic agents. In this review, we will discuss the most recent findings in the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ in the immune system, and the use of these antimalarial drugs on diseases.", "Title: Artificial Neural Networks Solve Musical Problems With Fourier Phase Spaces.\nContent: How does the brain represent musical properties? Even with our growing understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of music, the answer to this question remains unclear. One method for conceiving possible representations is to use artificial neural networks, which can provide biologically plausible models of cognition. One could train networks to solve musical problems, and then study how these networks encode musical properties. However, researchers rarely examine network structure in detail because networks are difficult to interpret, and because many assume that networks capture informal or subsymbolic properties. Here we report very high correlations between network connection weights and discrete Fourier phase spaces used to represent musical sets. This is remarkable because there is no clear mathematical relationship between network learning rules and discrete Fourier analysis. That networks discover Fourier phase spaces indicates that these spaces have an important role to play outside of formal music theory. Finding phase spaces in networks raises the strong possibility that Fourier components are possible codes for musical cognition.", "Title: Respiratory disease in pregnancy\nContent: Abstract Breathlessness in the absence of an underlying pathology is common in pregnancy. Asthma affects about 7% of women of childbearing age. Treatment is the same as for the non-pregnant population and most drugs are safe in pregnancy. Educating women to continue preventer inhaled corticosteroid therapy will reduce the risk of attacks. Respiratory infections are associated with a higher morbidity in pregnancy and should be treated aggressively. Most chronic pulmonary diseases do not alter fertility. Large reserves in respiratory function allow the fetus and mother to survive without compromise in most cases. The use of chest X-rays should not be avoided in pregnancy. Women with a chronic respiratory disease should receive pre-pregnancy counselling and education. Women should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting with the respiratory team. The presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale is associated with a high risk of death in pregnancy.", "Title: Fluorine makes a difference\nContent: Introducing fluorine into the chemical formula of self-assembling supramolecular systems usually makes for more stable and robust lattices. Now a dendron molecule has been found for which fluorination brings about a change in the self-assembly motif and an unexpected supramolecular architecture.", "Title: SARS-CoV Infection in a Restaurant from Palm Civet\nContent: Epidemiologic investigations showed that 2 of 4 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) identified in the winter of 2003–2004 were a waitress at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, that served palm civets as food and a customer who ate in the restaurant a short distance from animal cages. All 6 palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Partial spike (S) gene sequences of SARS-CoV from the 2 patients were identical to 4 of 5 S gene viral sequences from palm civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV from palm civets in the restaurant was most closely related to animal isolates. SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir, and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.", "Title: Shiga/verocytotoxins and Shiga/verotoxigenic Escherichia coli in animals.\nContent: Vero/Shiga toxins (VT/Stx) have an A-B structure: the A subunit carries the enzymatic activity and the B subunit binds the toxin to the membrane receptor (Gb3 or Gb4). The VT/Stx inhibit protein synthesis in the target eucaryotic cells, mainly the endothelial cells of blood vessels. The VT/Stx are subdivided into two families. VT1/Stx1 is a homogeneous family of toxins identical to the Stx of Shigella dysenteriae. VT2/Stx2 is a more heterogeneous family of toxins more distantly related to this Stx toxin. The VT2/Stx2 variants can be distinguished by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or the reaction with monoclonal antibodies. The VT/Stx-producing Escherichia coli are also subdivided into two main groups on the basis of the presence or absence of additional properties: the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) induce the formation of attaching/effacing lesions and carry a 60 MD plasmid encoding a specific haemolysin (the enterohaemolysin); the vero/shiga-toxigenic E. coli (VTEC/STEC) do not show these properties. The EHEC are isolated from humans and ruminants, especially young calves. They are associated with haemorrhagic enterocolitis and its sequelae in humans, the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). The VT/Stx play a role in the occurrence of blood in the faeces and in the HUS by their action on the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the intestinal submucosa and in the renal glomeruli, after resorption through the intestinal walls. The VTEC/STEC are isolated from piglets, calves and humans. In recently weaned piglets, they cause the oedema disease, an enterotoxaemia characterized by subcutaneous, mesenteric and cerebral oedemas, with nervous disorders as main clinical signs. The oedema disease is the consequence of the action of the VT/Stx on the endothelial cells of blood vessels in various organs. In calves and humans, the role in disease of VTEC/STEC is controversial, but they could be associated with some cases of diarrhoea and HUS. The case of the O157:H7 EHEC which are present in healthy cattle of various ages, but are highly virulent for humans is of special interest. The potential zoonotic aspect of VT/Stx-producing E. coli infections in animals is detailed chapter by chapter. Prophylaxis of these infections by vaccination is the subject of the discussion on the future of the research studies on these pathogenic bacteria.", "Title: Beyond Contact Tracing: Community-Based Early Detection for Ebola Response\nContent: The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa raised many questions about the control of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society. Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or impractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of multi-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.", "Title: Human Behaviour and Humanitarian Work\nContent: This chapter illustrates parallels and similarities between the interplay that links and shapes the four internal dimensions, and the interaction between individuals (micro-level), their close environment, including the institutions they work in (meso), society (macro) and the planet (meta). This perspective is applied to the working of humanitarian organizations with an overview of options for using this logic to optimize the full potential that is inherent to the mandate of these institutions. It is shown how the proposed paradigm shift can be started, expanded and maintained, from individuals to institutions and vice versa. The outline of Compassion for Change (C4C) proposes a concrete way for using the paradigm-shift that this book is based up to transform the internal culture of humanitarian and development organizations in order to reanimate and expand their external influence.", "Title: Structure of Mpro from COVID-19 virus and discovery of its inhibitors\nContent: A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1–4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.", "Title: Assessing racial and ethnic disparities using a COVID-19 outcomes continuum for New York State\nContent: PURPOSE: Heightened COVID-19 mortality among Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic communities (relative to white non-Hispanic) is well established. This study aims to estimate the relative contributions to fatality disparities in terms of differences in SARS-CoV-2 infections, diagnoses, and disease severity. METHODS: We constructed COVID-19 outcome continua (similar to the HIV care continuum) for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults in New York State. For each stage in the COVID-19 outcome continua (population, infection experience, diagnosis, hospitalization, fatality), we synthesized the most recent publicly-available data. We described each continuum using overall percentages, fatality rates, and relative changes between stages, with comparisons between race and ethnicity using risk ratios. RESULTS: Estimated per-population COVID-19 fatality rates were 0.03%, 0.18%, and 0.12% for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults. The 3.48-fold disparity for Hispanic, relative to white, communities was explained by differences in infection-experience, whereas the 5.38-fold disparity for non-Hispanic Black, relative to white, communities was primarily driven by differences in both infection-experience and in the need for hospitalization, given infection. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the most impactful stages upon which to intervene with programs and policies to build COVID-19 health equity.", "Title: Evidence synthesis of types and intensity of therapeutic land-based exercises to reduce pain in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.\nContent: The objective of this study is to construct an evidence synthesis to identify the types of land-based exercises most investigated in the current literature, the intervention duration, frequency of the programs and the exercises which are most frequently implemented. A search was performed on the reference list of included and excluded studies of one systematic review, on land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis and, an updated search of The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL and PEDro was completed. Two authors independently selected the studies and a third author was consulted for an additional opinion. The inclusion criteria were male or female with tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis, land-based exercises, non-exercise control group and randomized clinical trials. The exclusion criteria were mixed diagnosis or comparison to other types of exercise. The data were extracted by two authors. Fifty-five full-text articles were included. Strengthening, proprioception and aerobic exercises resulted in significant pain reduction. The intervention durations which were significant for pain reduction were either the period of 8-11 weeks or 12-15 weeks. The frequency of three times per week was found significant in comparison to a non-exercise control group. The results, which formed an evidence synthesis, demonstrate that there is substantial evidence regarding the benefits of strengthening exercises to reduce pain in knee osteoarthritis patients. Based on the included studies analysis, exercises should be performed three times weekly for a duration of 8-11 or 12-15 weeks. Health professionals working with knee osteoarthritis patients can use this evidence synthesis as a fast and pragmatic instrument to obtain information about several effective types of exercises for pain reduction.", "Title: Acronimi ed abbreviazioni\nContent: “The patient went from the ER to the OR and then to the ICU”. Indubbiamente il lessico dei medici è ricco di abbreviazioni, tanto che gli operatori della sanità di lingua italiana e inglese adoperano perlomeno dieci abbreviazioni per minuto (questa è una statistica fatta in casa, per favore non citatela). Questa alta prevalenza ci ha spinto a considerare le abbreviazioni in medicina come una dilagante epidemia.", "Title: Withanone and Withaferin-A are predicted to interact with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and block entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells\nContent: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initiated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and became pandemic causing high fatality and disrupted normal life calling world almost to a halt. Causative agent is a novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV). While new line of drug/vaccine development has been initiated world-wide, in the current scenario of high infected numbers, severity of the disease and high morbidity, repurposing of the existing drugs is heavily explored. Here, we used a homology-based structural model of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface receptor, required for entry of virus to the target host cell. Using the strengths of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester to TPMRSS2 in comparison to its known inhibitor, Camostat mesylate. We found that both Wi-A and Wi-N could bind and stably interact at the catalytic site of TMPRSS2. Wi-N showed stronger interactions with TMPRSS2 catalytic residues than Wi-A and was also able to induce changes in its allosteric site. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Wi-N on TMPRSS2 expression in MCF7 cells and found remarkable downregulation of TMPRSS2 mRNA in treated cells predicting dual action of Wi-N to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. Since the natural compounds are easily available/affordable, they may even offer a timely therapeutic/preventive value for the management of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also report that Wi-A/Wi-N content varies in different parts of Ashwagandha and warrants careful attention for their use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.", "Title: Hip abductor muscle activity during walking in individuals with gluteal tendinopathy.\nContent: The external hip adduction moment during walking is greater in individuals with gluteal tendinopathy (GT) than pain-free controls. Although this likely represents a greater demand on the hip abductor muscles implicated in GT, no study has investigated activation of these muscles in GT. For this purpose, fine wire electrodes were inserted into the segments of the gluteus minimus and medius muscles, and surface electrodes placed on the tensor fascia lata, upper gluteus maximus, and vastus lateralis muscles of eight individuals with, and eight without, GT. Participants underwent six walking trials. Individual muscle patterns were compared between groups using a wavelet-based linear effects model and muscle synergy analysis performed using non-negative matrix factorization to evaluate muscle activation patterns, within- and between-participant variability. Compared to controls, individuals with GT exhibited a more sustained initial burst of the posterior gluteus minimus and middle gluteus medius muscle segments. Two muscle synergies were identified; Synergy-1 activated in early-mid stance and Synergy-2 in early stance. In GT participants, posterior gluteus minimus and posterior gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata contributed more to Synergy-1 active during the period of single leg support. Participants with GT exhibited reduced within-participant variability of posterior gluteus medius and reduced between-participant variability of anterior gluteus minimus and medius and upper gluteus maximus. In conclusion, individuals with GT exhibit modified muscle activation patterns of the hip abductor muscles during walking, with potential relevance for gluteal tendon loading.", "Title: School attendance during a pandemic\nContent: When officials relax school attendance requirements as a prophylactic measure against a pandemic, students of higher prior performance take more absences, while students of lower prior performance keep going to school. Prior performance is positively associated with neighborhood income.", "Title: Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 clinical trials\nContent: Here, we present an overview of the clinical trials that are currently being conducted or have concluded to date on COVID-19 globally. A comprehensive search was conducted to present 16 trial registries from around the world. Collectively, there are 1,528 trials reported for COVID-19 to date. Out of them, 50 studies included paediatric age group from day 0 to less than or equal to 18 years of age. A few 18 studies involve only females and 20 only males. There are 2 trials currently underway in Bangladesh, 4 in Pakistan and 13 in India. Overall, 940 trials are related to medicines and/or interventions. They include standard of care for any viral illness, antivirals, anti-inflammatory and immune altering medications. Two out of 10 vaccine trials are novel vaccines. It is knowledgeable and resourceful to reach out to the concerned sponsor if a physician thinks his patient can benefit from the trials in the region.", "Title: Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece. Comparison between 2019 and 2020\nContent: In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.", "Title: Role of laboratory variables in differentiating SARS-coronavirus from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia within the first 72 h of hospitalization\nContent: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) testing be considered in epidemiologically high-risk patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) if no alternative diagnosis is identified after 72 h. The aim of this study was to identify routine laboratory variables that might indicate the need for SARS-CoV testing. Routine hematological/biochemical variables in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS (2003) were compared with those in consecutive patients hospitalized June–December 2004 with radiologically confirmed CAP. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to identify discriminating variables at baseline and by day 3 of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspiration and antigen detection for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were routinely performed in patients with CAP. Altogether, 181 patients with CAP (who remained undiagnosed by IFA) and 303 patients with SARS were studied. The mean intervals from symptom onset to admission were 3.1 and 2.8 days, respectively (p > 0.05). The etiological agent of CAP was identified retrospectively in only 39% of cases, the majority being bacterial pathogens. At baseline, age and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were the only independent discriminating variables (p < 0.0001). Using a value of <4.4 × 10(9)/l as the cutoff for ANC, the sensitivity and specificity of ANC for discriminating SARS were 64 and 95%, respectively (AUC 0.90). By day 3 of hospitalization, age (p < 0.0001), change in ANC (p = 0.0003), and change in bilirubin (p = 0.0065) were discriminating variables. A model combining age <65 years, a change in ANC of >−3 × 10(9)/l, and a change in bilirubin of ≥0 mmol/l had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 95% for SARS (AUC 0.90). There are only a few laboratory features (including lymphopenia) that clearly discriminate SARS from other causes of CAP. Nevertheless, when evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with CAP and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low ANC on presentation along with poor clinical and laboratory responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion for SARS and indicate a need to perform SARS-CoV testing.", "Title: Sensing Microbial RNA in the Cytosol\nContent: The innate immune system faces the difficult task of keeping a fine balance between sensitive detection of microbial presence and avoidance of autoimmunity. To this aim, key mechanisms of innate responses rely on isolation of pathogens in specialized subcellular compartments, or sensing of specific microbial patterns absent from the host. Efficient detection of foreign RNA in the cytosol requires an additional layer of complexity from the immune system. In this particular case, innate sensors should be able to distinguish self and non-self molecules that share several similar properties. In this review, we discuss this interplay between cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and the microbial RNA they detect. We describe how microbial RNAs gain access to the cytosol, which receptors they activate and counter-strategies developed by microorganisms to avoid this response.", "Title: Technique and short-term outcomes of single-port surgery for rectal cancer: a feasibility study of 25 patients.\nContent: BACKGROUND AND AIMS Although conventional laparoscopic surgery is less traumatic than open surgery, it does cause tissue trauma and multiple scar formation. The size and number of ports determine the extent of the trauma. Single-port laparoscopic surgery is assumed to minimize and perhaps eliminate the potential adverse effects of conventional laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to examine short-term outcomes of single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospectively collected data from 25 consecutive patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer between January 2010 and March 2012. Perioperative data, oncological resections, and short-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Male:female ratio was 10:15. Of the 25 patients, 44% had previously undergone abdominal surgery. Median body mass index was 24 kg/m(2) (range: 19-32 kg/m(2)). In all, four patients (16%) had neoadjuvant therapy. Median operating time was 260 min (range: 136-397 min). An additional port was needed in two patients, and one case was converted to hand-assisted approach. Median postoperative stay was 7 days (range: 4-39 days), and three patients (12%) were readmitted. Median lymph node harvest was 13 (range: 3-33). The surgical margins were clear in all patients. Complications were seen in six patients. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in selected patients with rectal cancer without compromising oncological safety and with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.", "Title: Covid-19, induced activation of hemostasis, and immune reactions: Can an auto-immune reaction contribute to the delayed severe complications observed in some patients?\nContent: Covid-19 is characterized by weak symptoms in most affected patients whilst severe clinical complications, with frequent fatal issues, occur in others. Disease severity is associated with age and comorbidities. Understanding of viral infectious mechanisms, and antibody immune response, can help to better control disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 has a major impact on the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), through its binding to the membrane cellular glycoprotein, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), then infecting cells for replication. This report hypothesizes the possible implication of an autoimmune response, induced by generation of allo- or autoantibodies to ACE-2, or to its complexes with viral spike protein. This could contribute to some delayed severe complications occurring in affected patients. We also propose a strategy for investigating this eventuality.", "Title: Radially expanding laparoscopic trocar ports significantly reduce postoperative pain in all age groups.\nContent: BACKGROUND Trocar entry points have been identified as a significant source of pain after laparoscopic surgery. This is particularly true of the larger 12-mm ports that require deep fascial closure to avoid port-site herniation. We investigated whether using radially expanding trocars not requiring fascial closure compared to conventional cutting trocars for the 12-mm port in transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repairs had any effect on postoperative analgesic requirements and return to work or normal activity. METHODS The number of days analgesia was required postoperatively and the number of days taken to return to normal activity was recorded for 143 consecutive patients who underwent TAPP hernia repair by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Exactly the same operative technique was used in these patients with the exception of the 12-mm port site entry. In group 1 (104 patients), a conventional cutting trocar was used requiring deep fascial closure. In group 2 (39 patients), a radially expanding trocar was used and the fascial defect was not closed. RESULTS Analgesia was required for an average of 10.5 days in group 1 and 2.4 days in group 2 (P < 0.001). The average time to return to work or to normal activity was 23.4 days in group 1 and 15.6 days in group 2 (P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the patients' age, sex, or operating time. CONCLUSION Using the laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair as a standardised operation, changing from 12-mm fascial port closure to a technique that uses port dilation (not requiring a potentially \"tight\" deeper fascial closure) in a similar group of patients shows that there is a significant reduction in postoperative analgesic requirement and an earlier return to productive work or normal lifestyle. Perhaps dilating ports should replace those larger 10-, 12-, and 15-mm ports that require deeper sutures in all laparoscopic surgical operations.", "Title: The novel coronavirus outbreak: what can be learned from China in public reporting?\nContent: The new coronavirus outbreak gets everyone’s attention. China’s national actions against the outbreak have contributed great contributions to the world. China has been learning from practice for better reporting and is fast to adapt itself. In this article we discuss China’s practice in public reporting and its implications to global health. Confirmed cases, dynamic suspected cases, recovered cases, and deaths have been reported both in accumulative numbers and their daily updates. Some ratio indictors reporting (fatality rate, recovery rate, etc.), trend reporting, and global surveillance have been applied as well. Some improvements can still be made. It is necessary to further explore the influential factors behind the indicators for interventions. Recommendations are made to the World Health Organization and other countries for better public reporting and surveillance.", "Title: Measuring lung mechanics of expiratory tidal breathing with non-invasive breath occlusion\nContent: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lung mechanics measurements provide clinically useful information about disease progression and lung health. Currently, there are no commonly practiced methods to non-invasively measure both resistive and elastic lung mechanics during tidal breathing, preventing the important information provided by lung mechanics from being utilised. This study presents a novel method to easily assess lung mechanics of spontaneously breathing subjects using a dynamic elastance, single-compartment lung model. METHODS: A spirometer with a built-in shutter was used to occlude expiration during tidal breathing, creating exponentially decaying flow when the shutter re-opened. The lung mechanics measured were respiratory system elastance and resistance, separated from the exponentially decaying flow, and interrupter resistance calculated at shutter closure. Progressively increasing resistance was added to the spirometer mouthpiece to simulate upper airway obstruction. The lung mechanics of 17 healthy subjects were successfully measured through spirometry. RESULTS: N = 17 (8 female, 9 male) healthy subjects were recruited. Measured decay rates ranged from 5 to 42/s, subjects with large variation of decay rates showed higher muscular breathing effort. Lung elastance measurements ranged from 3.9 to 21.2 cmH[Formula: see text] O/L, with no clear trend between change in elastance and added resistance. Resistance calculated from decay rate and elastance ranged from 0.15 to 1.95 cmH[Formula: see text] Os/L. These very small resistance values are due to the airflow measured originating from low-resistance areas in the centre of airways. Occlusion resistance measurements were as expected for healthy subjects, and increased as expected as resistance was added. CONCLUSIONS: This test was able to identify reasonable dynamic lung elastance and occlusion resistance values, providing new insight into expiratory breathing effort. Clinically, this lung function test could impact current practice. It does not require high levels of cooperation from the subject, allowing a wider cohort of patients to be assessed more easily. Additionally, this test can be simply implemented in a small standalone device, or with standard lung function testing equipment.", "Title: Pathophysiology of fatty acid oxidation disorders and resultant phenotypic variability\nContent: Fatty acids are a major fuel for the body and fatty acid oxidation is particularly important during fasting, sustained aerobic exercise and stress. The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders affecting fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney and liver. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction, hyperammonaemia and often cardiac dysfunction. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. The phenotypic diversity encountered in defects of fat oxidation is partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlation and certain identifiable environmental factors but there remain many unresolved questions regarding the complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences that dictate phenotypic expression. It is becoming increasingly clear that the view that most inherited disorders are purely monogenic diseases is a naive concept. In the future our approach to understanding the phenotypic diversity and management of patients will be more realistically achieved from a polygenic perspective.", "Title: Medical implication in the Bible and its relevance to modern medicine\nContent: Abstract The Holy Bible, as the root of Western civilization, has imposed great influence in the fields far beyond religion. In this thesis, the author intended to reveal the medical implication in the Holy Bible and its relevance to the modern medical science by exploring the biblical medical information and comparing it with the current medical theory and practice. The conclusion of the exploration is surprising yet inspiring: the Holy Bible, as an ancient religious book, contains rich medical information around themes such as sexual relations, dietary guidelines, hygiene, etc., which is not at odds, but in harmony with the modern medicine.", "Title: Prediction of clinical outcomes in individuals with chronic low back pain: a protocol for a systematic review with meta-analysis.\nContent: BACKGROUND Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most prevalent and recurrent conditions in the general population, with personal, professional, social and economic impact. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence about chronic low back pain (CLBP) prognosis, especially highlighting predictors that influence CLBP outcome. Existing systematic reviews are scarce, outdated and incomplete. The primary aim of this systematic review is to identify multivariable models and/or predictors associated with clinical outcomes in subjects with CLBP (namely pain intensity, disability, return to work, psychological well-being and quality of life). METHODS We will systematically search Ovid MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science databases for longitudinal studies, published until June 2017, including adults with CLBP (defined as persistent pain with ≥ 3 months duration), which studied the association between multivariable models and/or predictors with at least one of the selected clinical outcomes after ≥ 3 months of follow-up. Articles' screening and selection will be conducted by two reviewers, blindly and independently. Disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Models' discriminative ability will be assessed using C-statistic. The link between multivariable models and predictors with the clinical outcome will be analysed through association measures. Qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the available evidence will be performed. Meta-analysis will be conducted to aggregate each type of measure. In the absence or in the presence of only slight to moderate of heterogeneity, we will use the fixed or random effects model, respectively. In case of moderate to severe heterogeneity, an attempt to explain variability in detail will be made through subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analysis will be conducted according to clinical outcome, follow-up duration (≤ 6 months versus > 6 months) and type of context (pain management clinics versus other therapeutic settings). DISCUSSION We consider that it is urgent to highlight the available evidence about CLBP prognosis. This systematic review will help identify multivariable models and individual predictors that may enhance pain management success. One potential limitation will be the difficulty of aggregating quantitative measures from several prognostic models and predictors, with different clinical outcomes.

Epidemiologic investigations identified dromedary camels as the likely source of zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here we provide experimental support for camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission.", "Title: Distinct clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in female COVID-19 inpatients: a sex-stratified large-scale cohort study in Wuhan, China.\nContent: BACKGROUND As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak accelerates worldwide, it is highly significant to evaluate sex-specific clinical characteristics and outcomes, that may affect public health policies. METHODS COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 18and March 27, 2020 were evaluated. Clinical features, laboratory data, complications and outcomes were compared between females and males. Risk factors for mortality in the whole population, females and males were determined respectively. RESULTS There were 1667 (50.38%) females among the3309 patients included in this study. The mortality rate was only 5.9% in females but 12.7% in males. Compared with males, more females had no initial symptoms (11.1% vs 8.3%, p=0.008). Complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, cardiac injury and coagulation disorder were less common in females; critical illness was also significant less common in females (31.1% vs 39.4%, p<0.0001). Significantly fewer female patients received antibiotics treatment (p=0.001), antiviral therapy (p=0.025) glucocorticoids treatment (p<0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.0001) and had Intensive Care Unit admission (p<0.0001). A lower risk of death was found in females (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.58) after adjusting for age and coexisting diseases. Among females, age, malignancy, chronic kidney disease and days from onset to admission were significant associated with mortality, while chronic kidney disease was not risk factor in males. CONCLUSIONS Significantly more mild illness and fewer deaths were found in female COVID-19 inpatients and risk factors associated with mortality varied among male and female population.", "Title: Advocacy, promotion and e-learning: Supercourse for zoonosis\nContent: This paper discusses the history of emerging infectious diseases, risk communication and perception, and the Supercourse lectures as means to strengthen the concepts and definition of risk management and global governance of zoonosis. The paper begins by outlining some of the key themes and issues in infectious diseases, highlighting the way which historical analysis challenges ideas of the ‘newness’ of some of these developments. It then discusses the role of risk communication to public accountability. The bulk of the paper presents an overview of developments of the Internet-based learning system through the Supercourse lectures that may prove to be a strong arm for the promotion of the latest medical information particularly to developing countries.", "Title: The 2003 SARS Outbreaks in Taiwan\nContent: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-associated coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b; Ksiazek et al., 2003). The first known outbreak of SARS occurred in China’s Guangdong province in November, 2002 (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). By August 7 of the following year, SARS had spread to more than 30 countries, affecting 8,096 people and resulting in 774 deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 2004). In 2003, Taiwan experienced a series of SARS outbreaks and the Municipal Hoping Hospital (referred to hereafter as HP) in Taipei City suffered the first and the most serious outbreak of SARS-CoV nosocomial infections: 137 probable cases and 26 deaths (Division of Surveillance and Investigation, Center for Disease Control, Taiwan, 2003; Lan et al., 2005b). According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan, 364 of the 664 probable Taiwanese SARS cases reported to the World Health Organization were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or neutralizing antibody tests (Center for Disease Control, 2003a). In this chapter, we will discuss the molecular and clinical epidemiology of SARS infection in Taiwan during 2003.", "Title: Shifts in circulating lymphocyte subsets in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP): pathogenic role and diagnostic relevance\nContent: Abstract Cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) are usually lymphopenic and have lymphoid depletion evident in spleen and lymph nodes. In particular, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in tissues decreases during the evolution of FIP lesions. This decrease is most likely due to increased lymphocyte apoptotic rate. In contrast, cats infected with the Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) develop a follicular hyperplasia in the peripheral lymph nodes. The current study was devised to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of shifts in circulating lymphocyte subsets in FIP. Peripheral blood from cats with FIP was evaluated and compared with peripheral blood from clinically healthy cats living in both FCoV-free and FCoV-endemic catteries. Blood from cats with diseases other than FIP was also examined in order to define the diagnostic relevance of the changes. Lymphocyte subsets were analysed by flow cytometry, using a whole blood indirect immunofluorescence technique and mAbs specific for feline CD5, CD4, CD8, CD21. The results of the current study suggest that cats recently infected with FCoV that do not develop the disease have a transient increase in T cells; cats from groups with high prevalence of FIP have a moderate but persistent decrease in T cell subsets; cats with FIP have a very severe decrease in all the subsets of lymphocytes. Moreover, during FIP many lymphocytes do not express any membrane antigen, most likely due to early apoptosis. Cats with diseases other than FIP also had decreased number of lymphocytes: as a consequence, the diagnostic relevance of these findings is very low. Nevertheless, the lack of flow cytometric changes had a high negative predictive value (NPV), thus allowing to exclude FIP from the list of possible diagnoses in cats with normal cytograms.", "Title: Treatment of Intermediate-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Japan: Position of Curative Therapies.\nContent: Background Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard therapy for intermediate-stage (IM) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, IM-HCC includes various clinical conditions, and various therapies were conducted in practice. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the actually conducted treatments for IM-HCC and their efficacies to elucidate the treatment strategies suitable for IM-HCC. Methods This study included 627 IM-HCC of 5,260 HCC from 9 hospitals. We examined the treatment strategies of these patients and analyzed the efficacy of each therapy with the Cox proportional hazard model and propensity score-matched analysis. Results Liver resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and TACE were performed in 165, 108, and 351 patients, respectively. Liver resection and RFA were preferably selected in cases of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-B1/B2, and patient survival was significantly longer than in those treated with TACE (p< 0.0001). However, no beneficial effect of these active therapies was observed in cases of BCLC-B3/B4. Multivariate analysis revealed that surgical resection (hazard ratio = 0.384) and RFA (hazard ratio = 0.597) were negative risk factors for survival. Propensity score-matching analysis revealed that -survival of RFA-treated patients was longer than that of TACE-treated patients (p = 0.036). Conclusion RFA and surgical resection were effective for IM-HCC, particularly in BCLC-B1/B2 cases.", "Title: Chapter 13 Viral Disease\nContent: Abstract This chapter discusses infections of rats with viruses in the following 14 virus families: Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Pneumoviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, and Reoviridae. Serological surveys indicate that parvoviruses, coronaviruses, cardioviruses, and pneumoviruses are the most prevalent in laboratory rats. A new polyomavirus and a new cardiovirus that cause disease in laboratory rats are described. Metagenomic analyses of feces or intestinal contents from wild rats have detected viruses from an additional nine virus families that could potentially cause infections in laboratory rats.", "Title: MEMIS: Multimodal Emergency Management Information System\nContent: The recent upsurge in the usage of social media and the multimedia data generated therein has attracted many researchers for analyzing and decoding the information to automate decision-making in several fields. This work focuses on one such application: disaster management in times of crises and calamities. The existing research on disaster damage analysis has primarily taken only unimodal information in the form of text or image into account. These unimodal systems, although useful, fail to model the relationship between the various modalities. Different modalities often present supporting facts about the task, and therefore, learning them together can enhance performance. We present MEMIS, a system that can be used in emergencies like disasters to identify and analyze the damage indicated by user-generated multimodal social media posts, thereby helping the disaster management groups in making informed decisions. Our leave-one-disaster-out experiments on a multimodal dataset suggest that not only does fusing information in different media forms improves performance, but that our system can also generalize well to new disaster categories. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the system is responsive and computationally efficient.", "Title: Oxygen supplies in disaster management.\nContent: Mass casualty events and disasters, both natural and human-generated, occur frequently around the world and can generate scores of injured or ill victims in need of resources. Of the available medical supplies, oxygen remains the critical consumable resource in disaster management. Strategic management of oxygen supplies in disaster scenarios remains a priority. Hospitals have large supplies of liquid oxygen and a supply of compressed gas oxygen cylinders that allow several days of reserve, but a large influx of patients from a disaster can strain these resources. Most backup liquid oxygen supplies are attached to the main liquid system and supply line. In the event of damage to the main system, the reserve supply is rendered useless. The Strategic National Stockpile supplies medications, medical supplies, and equipment to disaster areas, but it does not supply oxygen. Contracted vendors can deliver oxygen to alternate care facilities in disaster areas, in the form of concentrators, compressed gas cylinders, and liquid oxygen. Planning for oxygen needs following a disaster still presents a substantial challenge, but alternate care facilities have proven to be valuable in relieving pressure from the mass influx of patients into hospitals, especially for those on home oxygen who require only an electrical source to power their oxygen concentrator.", "Title: Mobility and interactions of coronavirus nonstructural protein 4.\nContent: Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mouse hepatitis coronavirus nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) was shown to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to be recruited to the coronavirus replicative structures. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that while the membranes of the ER are continuous with those harboring the replicative structures, the mobility of nsp4 at the latter structures is relatively restricted. In agreement with that observation, nsp4 was shown to be engaged in homotypic and heterotypic interactions, the latter with nsp3 and nsp6. In addition, the coexpression of nsp4 with nsp3 affected the subcellular localization of the two proteins.", "Title: Self-gripping Covidien™ ProGrip™ mesh versus polypropylene mesh in open inguinal hernia repair: multicenter short term results.\nContent: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes following sutureless ProGrip™ mesh repair to traditional Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh secured with sutures. Data were collected prospectively and were analyzed for 57 male and 3 female patients with 60 inguinal hernias. All patients included underwent open surgical repair for inguinal hernia with polypropylene mesh or ProGrip mesh. In our two centres study sixty patients were operated; 30 were treated with Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh (L group) and 30 with ProGrip mesh (P group) with or without fixation. The primary parameter measured was intensity of postoperative pain using visual analogue scale (VAS); other outcomes included assessment of early and late complication. VAS was assessed in 7 days and 4 months of the postoperative period. Our results show that VAS scored at the 7th postoperative day was 1.5 for the ProGrip mesh versus 4.4 in Lichtenstein repair group. The difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Surgery duration was significantly shorter in the P group (24.9 vs. 58.3 min; P=0.001). No recurrence was observed at 3 months in both groups. The 3-months follow-up has shown that time necessary to return to daily routine activity was significantly lower in the P group during the (P=0.001). Surgery duration, early and late postoperative, pain and return to daily routine activity rates were significantly reduced with self-gripping ProGrip mesh compared to Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh.", "Title: Efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol for the treatment of chronic low back pain in elderly patients\nContent: BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent and disabling condition in the elderly, and yet it is undertreated and understudied in this patient population. Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (&#8805; 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS: At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3 ± 1.4 and - 4.8 ± 2.1; P < 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients. The percentage of patients with a neuropathic component decreased similarly in young and elderly patients (from 38 to 0% and from 19 to 3%; P < 0.01). Quality of life and sleep improved. The performances in global cognition and sustained attention tasks remained stable or improved across all age group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that tapentadol extended release maintains efficacy and good tolerability in CLBP patients with advancing age.", "Title: Perceived vulnerability to disease and attitudes towards public health measures: COVID-19 in Flanders, Belgium\nContent: During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments installed measures to contain the disease. Information about these measures was disseminated through news media. Nonetheless, many individuals did not abide by these guidelines. We investigated how perceived vulnerability to disease and personality characteristics related to support for public health measures. We analyzed survey data of 1000 Flemish (Belgium) adults, collected between March 17, 2020 and March 22, 2020. Older age, low educational attainment, gender (female) and work situation (no telecommuting) were associated with greater perceived vulnerability. Greater expectations of loneliness and more solidarity with our fellow men were associated with gender (female), younger age and work situation (telecommuting). Greater perceived vulnerability to disease was related to a greater belief that public health measures protect the population, but also to a critical stance towards the Belgian government's handling of the crisis. High agreeableness and high emotional stability were associated with respectively greater belief that health measures protect the population, and greater support for the government's crisis management. Watching television news was related to a greater belief that public health measures are necessary, and specifically consuming public television news increased support for public health measures. We discuss the implications for handling the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Title: COVID-related family separation and trauma in the intensive care unit.\nContent: Due to stringent but necessary infection control mandates, the COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly resulting in family separation from loved ones admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Even in normal circumstances, ICU families frequently experience significant psychological dysfunction-including posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related reactions, especially during the end of life period. The COVID pandemic likely will exacerbate these reactions as more and more families are being barred from the ICU. Consequently, ICU families are facing additional barriers in fully understanding the complex medical needs of their loved ones (and hence being able to make informed care decisions on their behalf); establishing rapport and bonding with nurses and other members of the ICU treatment team; and, in the event that a loved one passes, achieving closure. ICU health care providers can take steps to mitigate these outcomes by being mindful of the unique stressors ICU families are currently facing and tailoring their communication and behavior accordingly.

However, late results in terms of weight loss or weight regain are inconsistent and may warrant a second procedure. This retrospective study analyzes the laparoscopic options for revisional surgery after LRYGB. METHODS Between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2009, 70 patients underwent a new laparoscopic procedure for poor weight loss or weight regain after LRYGB. The revisional procedure was performed a median of 2.6 years after the initial bypass operation. Fifty-eight patients were available for follow-up (82.9 %); 19 underwent distalization; and 39 a new restrictive procedure. RESULTS The mean mass index (BMI) before the revisional procedure was 39.1 + 11.3 kg/m(2) (30.8-51.8), down from 42.7 + 19.7 kg/m(2) (33.0-56.6) initially, which corresponded to a percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) of 12.4 + 9.3 % (-1.0-29.1). After the corrective procedure, with a follow-up of approximately 4 years, mean BMI was 29.6 + 12.4 kg/m(2) (18.0-45.5), for a significant additional percentage of EWL of 53.7 + 9.8 % (2.0-65.8). The overall complication rate was 20.7 %, and the reoperation rate was 7.3 %. The overall leak rate was 12.1 %. Patients suffering from leaks could consistently be treated conservatively or by stent placement. Two patients needed reconversion after distal bypass. The satisfaction index was good in just over 50 % of the patients. CONCLUSION Revisional laparoscopic surgery after RYGB performed for weight issues provides good additional weight loss but carries significant morbidity. Leaks can usually be handled non-surgically. Patient satisfaction is only fair.", "Title: Rationale and Design of ORCHID: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Hydroxychloroquine for Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19.\nContent: The Outcomes Related to COVID-19 treated with Hydroxychloroquine among In-patients with symptomatic Disease (ORCHID) trial is a multicenter, blinded, randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. This document provides the rationale and background for the trial and highlights key design features. We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multi-center, randomized trial during a pandemic, including: 1) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; 2) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; 3) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; 4) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and 5) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multi-center trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics. The ORCHID trial will provide high-quality, clinically relevant data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04332991) prior to enrollment of the first patient on April 2, 2020.", "Title: Reconstruction option of abdominal wounds with large tissue defects.\nContent: BACKGROUND Abdominal wall defects result from trauma, abdominal wall tumors, necrotizing infections or complications of previous abdominal surgeries. Apart from cosmetics, abdominal wall defects have strong negative functional impact on the patients.Many different techniques exist for abdominal wall repair. Most problematic and troublesome are defects, where major part of abdominal wall had to be resected and tissue for transfer or reconstruction is absent. CASE PRESENTATION Authors of the article present operative technique, in which reconstruction of abdominal wall was managed by composite polypropylene mesh with absorbable collagen film, creation of granulation tissue with use of NPWT (negative pressure wound therapy), and subsequent split skin grafting.Three patients with massive abdominal wall defect were successfully managed and abdominal wall reconstruction was performed by mentioned technique. Functional and cosmetic effect is acceptable and patients have good postoperative quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Patients with giant abdominal defects can benefit from described technique. It serves as the only option, with which abdominal wall is fully reconstructed without need for the secondary intervention.", "Title: Effects of somatostatin analogs on a growth hormone-releasing hormone secreting bronchial carcinoid, in vivo and in vitro studies.\nContent: CONTEXT A 56-yr-old woman presented with acromegaly, a pulmonary mass, and elevated levels of GHRH, GH, and IGF-I. Histological examination revealed a bronchial carcinoid with positive staining for GHRH. Somatostatin analogs (SAs) can play an important role in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, dependent on the somatostatin receptor subtype (sst) expression pattern. The sst pattern in bronchial carcinoids and effects of SAs have not been extensively investigated, particularly not for the recently developed universal SA SOM230 (Pasireotide) that has high affinity for sst1, 2, 3, and 5. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to investigate the in vivo response of a GHRH-producing bronchial carcinoid to octreotide (OCT), its sst-expression profile, and in vitro responses to different SAs, including SOM230. METHODS In vivo, 50 microg OCT was administered, and plasma GH and GHRH responses were determined. In vitro, the expression of ssts was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the effects of SOM230 and OCT on GHRH secretion were evaluated in primary cell cultures of the carcinoid tissue. RESULTS In vivo, OCT administration fully suppressed GH and GHRH levels. In vitro, sst1 mRNA was most abundant, followed by sst2 and sst5. Both SOM230 and OCT inhibited GHRH production dose dependently (SOM230 100 nm vs. control, P = 0.01; OCT 110 nm vs. control, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this case of a GHRH-producing bronchial carcinoid, we demonstrated that SOM230 was a potent inhibitor of GHRH production in vitro and was at least equally potent compared with OCT. Therefore, SOM230 may be a potential therapeutic agent to control GHRH secretion in ectopic acromegaly.", "Title: Collaborative Intervention of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: Rapid Response Team\nContent: On May 20th 2015, a 68 year old man was the first to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) in Korea. He travelled to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar for 16 days. On May 4th 2015, the patient entered Korea, with febrile sense and respiratory symptoms that appeared on May 11th. The MERS-CoV Outbreak became worse and several patients had to be admitted throughout various hospitals starting at the beginning of June. This situation led to a nationwide chaos. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) was organized after the Korean government's calling for specialists that were composed of 15 Infectious disease Doctors and 2 Infection Control professionals on the 8th of June 2015. The main purpose of the RRT were: 1) consultation to the Government controlling MERS-CoV outbreak. 2) Visit hospitals that were exposed to MERS-CoV infected patients, and to provide advice regarding infection control strategy for rehabilitating of the exposed hospitals. Since June 8th, the RRT visited more than 10 hospitals and an effective consultation was carried out. Most of the hospitals were recovering from the MERS outbreak since early July. Cooperation between the government and private sector experts was very effective. The efforts of government and private sector experts overcame the initial chaos situation. It could prevent further deterioration of the MERS outbreak.", "Title: Efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compared to medically managed controls in meeting the American Diabetes Association composite end point goals for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nContent: BACKGROUND The treatment goals recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus include hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) <7.0%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 mmHg. Only 10% of conventionally treated patients reach these goals as a composite endpoint. The efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in meeting this composite endpoint has not been reported. METHODS We compared our database of patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing RYGB to a database of patients with medically managed type 2 diabetes and at least 2 years of follow-up data. RESULTS Ultimately, 152 RYGB patients were compared to 115 routine medical management (RMM) patients for whom data on the composite endpoint were available over 2 years. The results show significant decrease in body mass index (kilograms per square meter) in the RYGB group compared to the RMM group (P < 0.001). HbA1C, LDL cholesterol, and SBP all significantly improved in the RYGB group (all P ≤ 0.01) and did not demonstrate any significant change in the RMM group. Over 2 years, when evaluating all three endpoints, the RYGB group (10.5% to 38.2%, P < 0.001) demonstrated increased achievement of the ADA goals compared to the RMM group (13.9% to 17.4%, P = 0.47). There was a significant decrease in medication use in the RYGB cohort; however, discontinuation of medications was sometimes inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS RYGB achieves the ADA composite endpoint more frequently than conventional therapy and with less medication.", "Title: Prediction of guilt and shame proneness based on disruption to psychological contract: A new light for corruption prevention\nContent: Amid controversy over plurality and contestation of the meanings of corruption, previous reviews and studies showed that proneness to moral emotions, i.e. shame and guilt, can predict one's corruption behavior. To give a theoretical basis for the efforts of preventing corruption that is thick with emotional nuance, this present study employs disruption to psychological contract, i.e. psychological contract breach (PCB), as a predictor of moral emotions proneness. The study involving 265 employees (169 males, 96 females; M(age) = 32.32 years old; SD(age) = 7.28 years) of four big private banks in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, shows that PCB—with noting that, in this study, its scale operational scoring represents, reversely, the contract fulfillment—can predict Guilt-negative behavior evaluation (Guilt-NBE), Guilt-repair (Guilt-REP), and Shame-negative self-evaluation (Shame-NSE); all in negative directions, proved via simple linear regression analyses. Further analysis showed a more dynamic relationship between PCB and Guilt-NBE that fits to a cubic regression model. This study contributes to the axiological aspect of business psychology, especially in the ethical psychology of banking industry.", "Title: Manifestations cutanées de la panleucopénie féline chez un chat\nContent: Résumé Un chat adulte exprimant une forme nerveuse et entéritique de la panleucopénie féline développe des lésions cutanées purpuriques. L’analyse histopathologique de biopsies cutanées met en évidence des lésions de vascularite non leucocytoclasique à prédominance mononucléée. Les vascularites sont particulièrement rares chez le chat et souvent idiopathiques. La démarche diagnostique comprend l’éviction de plusieurs hypothèses, médicamenteuses ou virales (virus d’immunodéficience féline [FIV], virus leucémogène félin [FeLV], péritonite infectieuse féline [PIF]). Ce cas rappelle le purpura Henoch-Schönlein, cause la plus fréquente de vascularite chez les enfants, qui serait associé à diverses causes dont une infection par le parvovirus B19. Summary Purpuric cutaneous lesions occurred on an adult neutered cat diagnosed with a nervous and enteritic form of panleukopenia. Histopathology of cutaneous samples revealed predominant mononuclear non-leukocytoclasic vasculitis. Feline vasculitis has rarely been reported and etiological agents are difficult to identify. Differential diagnosis ruled out cutaneous drug reaction and several viral hypotheses such as FIV, FeLV and FIP. This case is similar to the children's most frequently vasculitis: the Henoch-Schönlein purpura, which is probably caused by the parvovirus B19.", "Title: Socioeconomic, geographic and climatic risk factors for canine parvovirus infection and euthanasia in Australia\nContent: Abstract Infection of canids with canine parvovirus (CPV) can result in severe, often fatal disease. This study aimed to examine climatic, socioeconomic and geographic risk factors for CPV infection and CPV-associated euthanasia in Australia. Australian veterinary hospital responses (534; 23.5 %) to a national veterinary survey of CPV case occurrences and euthanasias in 2016 were used. Severe caseloads (>40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50–110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) – the greater the disadvantage, the more reports. Strong negative correlations were found between case numbers and the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (rSP = –0.3357, p < 0.0001) and also between euthanasia and the Index of Education and Occupation (rSP = –0.3762, p < 0.0001). Hospitals in more remote areas were also more likely to report cases and to euthanize without treatment (p < 0.0001). Of the climate variables, temperature of the hottest month was most strongly positively correlated with case numbers (rSP = 0.421, p < 0.0001), and lower annual rainfall was associated with more case-reporting hospitals (p < 0.0001). These results confirm that socioeconomic disadvantage is a significant risk-factor for CPV infection and outcome, and high temperature may also contribute to risk.", "Title: Scarcity in the Covid-19 Pandemic\nContent: As we write, U.S. cities and states with extensive community transmission of Covid-19 are in harm's way-not only because of the disease itself but also because of prior and current failures to act. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, public health agencies and hospitals developed but never adequately implemented preparedness plans. Focused on efficiency in a competitive market, health systems had few incentives to maintain stockpiles of essential medical equipment. Just-in-time economic models resulted in storage of only those supplies needed then. At the same time, global purchasing in search of lower prices reduced the number of U.S. suppliers, with hospitals dependent on foreign companies. There is still a possibility that the pandemic will be manageably bad rather than unmanageably catastrophic in this country. Immediate, powerful, and sustained federal action could make the difference.", "Title: Waiting for the Flu: Cognitive Inertia and the Spanish Influenza Pandemic of 1918–19\nContent: This study looks at public awareness and understanding of the Spanish flu in the United States between June 1918, when the flu became “Spanish,” and the end of September when the deadly second wave reached the majority of the country. Based on an extensive reading of local newspapers, it finds a near universal lack of preparation or panic or other signs of personal concern among those in the unaffected areas, despite extensive and potentially worrying coverage of the flu's progress. The normal reaction to news of the inexorable approach of a pandemic of uncertain virulence is anxiety and action. The Spanish flu produced neither in the uninfected areas for a month. The most likely reason appears to be cognitive inertia—the tendency of existing beliefs or habits of thought to blind people to changed realities. This inertia grew out of the widespread understanding of flu as a seasonal visitor that while frequently unpleasant almost never killed the strong and otherwise healthy. This view of the flu was powerful enough that it blinded many in the unaffected regions to the threat for weeks even in the face of daily or near daily coverage of the pandemic's spread.", "Title: The Environmental Impacts of the Coronavirus\nContent: The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has resulted in global lockdowns, sharply curtailing economic activity. It is a unique experiment with substantial impacts that will form the agenda for research. There are five sets of questions: the short-term impacts on emissions, the natural environment and environmental policy, including regulations and COP26; longer-term consequences from the deployment of macroeconomic monetary and fiscal stimuli, and investment in green deals; possible further deglobalisation and its impact on climate change and nature; intergenerational environmental impacts including debt and pollution burdens on future generations; and possible behavioural changes to the environment, both positive and negative.", "Title: Correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of UK-based respondents\nContent: BACKGROUND: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and &#8805;75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and &#8805;£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of UK adults self-isolating/social distancing females, younger age groups, those with a lower annual income, current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health.", "Title: Combined effects of temperature and macronutrient balance on life-history traits in Drosophila melanogaster: implications for life-history trade-offs and fundamental niche.\nContent: Temperature and nutrition are amongst the most influential environmental determinants of Darwinian fitness in ectotherms. Since the ongoing climate warming is known to alter nutritional environments encountered by ectotherms, a precise understanding of the integrated effects of these two factors on ectotherm performance is essential for improving the accuracy of predictions regarding how ectotherms will respond to climate warming. Here we employed response surface methodology to examine how multiple life-history traits were expressed across a grid of environmental conditions representing full combinations of six ambient temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, 31, 33 °C) and eight dietary protein:carbohydrate ratios (P:C = 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1) in Drosophila melanogaster. Different life-history traits were maximized in different regions in the two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space. The optimal temperature and P:C ratio identified for adult lifespan (13 °C and 1:16) were lower than those for early-life female fecundity (28 °C and 4:1). Similar divergence in thermal and nutritional optima was found between body mass at adult emergence (18 °C and P:C 1:1) and the rate of pre-adult development (28 °C and P:C 4:1). Pre-adult survival was maximized over a broad range of temperature (18-28 °C) and P:C ratio (1:8-8:1). These results indicate that the occurrence of life-history trade-offs is regulated by both temperature and dietary P:C ratio. The estimated measure of fitness was maximized at 23 °C and P:C 2:1. Based on the shape of the response surface constructed for this estimated fitness, we characterized the fundamental thermal and nutritional niche for D. melanogaster with unprecedented detail.", "Title: Perspectives on Battling COVID-19 in Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean\nContent: Perspectives on Battling COVID-19 in Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.", "Title: Factors associated with duration of viral shedding in adults with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China: A retrospective cohort study\nContent: Abstract Objectives To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore potential factors. Results Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21). Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding. Conclusions This is the study with relatively large sample size that mainly focused on the duration of viral shedding and relevant factors in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantine of infected patients.", "Title: Inactivation of murine norovirus on a range of copper alloy surfaces is accompanied by loss of capsid integrity.\nContent: Norovirus is one of the most common causes of acute viral gastroenteritis. The virus is spread via the fecal-oral route, most commonly from infected food and water, but several outbreaks have originated from contamination of surfaces with infectious virus. In this study, a close surrogate of human norovirus causing gastrointestinal disease in mice, murine norovirus type 1 (MNV-1), retained infectivity for more than 2 weeks following contact with a range of surface materials, including Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. Persistence was slightly prolonged on ceramic surfaces. A previous study in our laboratory observed that dry copper and copper alloy surfaces rapidly inactivated MNV-1 and destroyed the viral genome. In this new study, we have observed that a relatively small change in the percentage of copper, between 70 and 80% in copper nickels and 60 and 70% in brasses, had a significant influence on the ability of the alloy to inactivate norovirus. Nickel alone did not affect virus, but zinc did have some antiviral effect, which was synergistic with copper and resulted in an increased efficacy of brasses with lower percentages of copper. Electron microscopy of purified MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and stainless steel surfaces suggested that a massive breakdown of the viral capsid had occurred on copper. In addition, MNV-1 that had been exposed to copper and treated with RNase demonstrated a reduction in viral gene copy number. This suggests that capsid integrity is compromised upon contact with copper, allowing copper ion access to the viral genome.", "Title: Acute lower respiratory tract infections in soldiers, South Korea, April 2011-March 2012.\nContent: During April 2011-March 2012, we retrospectively reviewed medical records for South Korea soldiers to assess the etiology and epidemiology of acute viral lower respiratory tract infections. Adenovirus was the most commonly identified virus (63.2%) and the most common cause of pneumonia (79.3%) and hospitalization (76.6%); 3 soldiers died of adenovirus-related illness.", "Title: Investigation of the control of coronavirus subgenomic mRNA transcription by using T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts.\nContent: The subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are not produced in equimolar amounts. We have developed a reporter gene system to investigate the control of this differential subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Transcription of mRNAs by the TGEV polymerase was obtained from negative-sense RNA templates generated in situ from DNA containing a T7 promoter. A series of gene cassettes was produced; these cassettes comprised the reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of transcription-associated sequences (TASs) (also referred to as intergenic sequences and promoters) believed to be involved in the synthesis of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs 6 and 7. The gene cassettes were designed so that negative-sense RNA copies of the CAT gene with sequences complementary to the TGEV TASs, or modified versions, at the 3' end would be synthesized in situ by T7 RNA polymerase. Using this system, we have demonstrated that CAT was expressed from mRNAs derived from the T7-generated negative-sense RNA transcripts only in TGEV-infected cells and only from transcripts possessing a TGEV negative-sense TAS. Analysis of the CAT mRNAs showed the presence of the TGEV leader RNA sequence at the 5' end, in keeping with observations that all coronavirus mRNAs have a 5' leader sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the genomic RNA. Our results indicated that the CAT mRNAs were transcribed from the in situ-synthesized negative-sense RNA templates without the requirement of TGEV genomic 5' or 3' sequences on the T7-generated negative-sense transcripts (3'-TAS-CAT-5'). Modification of the TGEV TASs indicated (i) that the degree of potential base pairing between the 3' end of the leader RNA and the TGEV negative-sense TAS was not the sole determinant of the amount of subgenomic mRNA transcribed and (ii) that other factors, including nucleotides flanking the TAS, are involved in the regulation of transcription of TGEV subgenomic mRNAs.", "Title: Randomized clinical trial of the impact of insulin therapy on liver function in patients undergoing major liver resection.\nContent: BACKGROUND Postoperative liver dysfunction is the major source of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy. This study tested the benefits of a metabolic support protocol based on insulin infusion, for reducing liver dysfunction following hepatic resection. METHODS Consecutive consenting patients scheduled for liver resection were randomized to receive preoperative dextrose infusion followed by insulin therapy using the hyperinsulinaemic normoglycaemic clamp protocol (n = 29) or standard therapy (control group, n = 27). Patients in the insulin therapy group followed a strict dietary regimen for 24 h before surgery. Intravenous dextrose was started at 2 mg per kg per min the night before and continued until surgery. Hyperinsulinaemic therapy for a total of 24 h was initiated at 2 munits per kg per min at induction of anaesthesia, and continued at 1 munit per kg per min after surgery. Normoglycaemia was maintained (3.5-6.0 mmol/l). Control subjects received no additional dietary supplement and a conventional insulin sliding scale during fasting. All patients were tested serially to evaluate liver function using the Schindl score. Liver tissue samples were collected at two time points during surgery to measure glycogen levels. RESULTS Demographics were similar in the two groups. More liver dysfunction occurred in the control cohort (liver dysfunction score range 0-8 versus 0-4 with insulin therapy; P = 0.031). Median (interquartile range) liver glycogen content was 278 (153-312) and 431 (334-459) µmol/g respectively (P = 0.011). The number of complications rose with increasing severity of postoperative liver dysfunction (P = 0.032) CONCLUSION: The glucose-insulin protocol reduced postoperative liver dysfunction and improved liver glycogen content.

This article describes a case of extensive external root resorption in the middle third of the root of a maxillary right incisor. Root canal treatment was performed followed by surgical intervention. The resorptive defect was debrided and part of the root was repaired with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Postoperative follow-up revealed complete healing.", "Title: Is SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) different from other PVOD?\nContent: BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread rapidly across the globe afflicting many with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the infection rates rise, a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals have been reported to complain of olfactory disturbances at an alarming rate. Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. METHODS: A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old. CONCLUSIONS: PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction demonstrates considerable similarities in epidemiological trends and disease sequela of other viruses to suggest identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Further studies such as intranasal inoculation and histological biopsies are needed to support our hypothesis.", "Title: Clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective single-center experience of a designated hospital in Poland\nContent: INTRODUCTION: Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) in Poland, the worldwide pandemic has spread throughout the country, leading to many hospital admissions. There has been an urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory­confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV 2) infection in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short­ term outcomes of SARS­CoV­2-positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 169 consecutive patients with laboratory­ confirmed COVID­ 19 with regard to their clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 years or older (88; 52.1%), 51.5% were male, and 78.3% had comorbidities. The majority of patients (106; 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%), and fatigue (33%). Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission. Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P <0.001). Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate). CONCLUSIONS: Polish patients with COVID­19 have similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes to those observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier. Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified.", "Title: Hematogenous infection of Sprague-Dawley rats with Mycoplasma pulmonis: development of a model for maternal and fetal infection\nContent: Objectives The specific objective of this study was to conduct a dose response experiment with Mycoplasma pulmonis in Sprague-Dawley rats to develop a reproducible animal model of maternal and fetal infection that would provide a versatile mechanism to address the innate fetal immune response during intrauterine infection. Study Design Pregnant rats were infected intravenously at gestation day 14 with 0 (control), 101, 103, 105, and 107 colony forming units of M pulmonis and necropsied at gestational day 18. Quantitative culture of maternal and fetal tissues as well as histopathologic examination of the placenta were performed. Results We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose. Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P < .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P = .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 103 colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 107 colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues. Conclusions In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.", "Title: Risks and Impact of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Adults\nContent: BACKGROUND: The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear. PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None. (PROSPERO: registration number pending).", "Title: Reconstruction of the jejunoesophageal anastomosis with a circular mechanical stapler in total laryngopharyngectomy defects.\nContent: BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to demonstrate the technical feasibility and potential benefits of using a circular mechanical stapler with free jejunal transfer for jejunoesophageal anastomosis in total laryngopharyngectomy reconstruction while comparing the rates of fistula and stricture. METHODS This study was a retrospective review of 12 free jejunal flaps completed with circular mechanical stapler for the jejunoesophageal anastomosis with comparison to 17 jejunal free flaps where all anastomoses were hand sewn. RESULTS In all, 29 patients underwent free jejunal transfer: 12 had jejunal free flap with circular mechanical stapler for jejunoesophageal anastomosis, whereas 17 patients had hand-sewn anastomosis. Corresponding rates of fistula and stricture were 0/12 fistulas and 3/12 strictures in the stapler cohort and 2/17 fistulas with 0/17 strictures in the hand-sewn cohort. No statistically significant difference in rate of fistula was observed between each cohort, whereas a trend toward increased rate of stricture (p = .06) was observed in the stapled anastomosis cohort. CONCLUSIONS Use of circular mechanical stapler appears to be a safe and effective technique at the jejunoesophageal anastomosis for total laryngopharyngeal defects with comparable fistula and stricture rates to grafts that are hand sewn.", "Title: 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics\nContent: We believe a point-of-care (PoC) device for the rapid detection of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial and urgently needed. With this perspective, we give suggestions regarding a potential candidate for the rapid detection of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as factors for the preparedness and response to the outbreak of the COVID-19.", "Title: Semi-free forearm flap for pharyngeal-esophageal reconstruction after radiation therapy.\nContent: Reconstruction of the pharynx and upper esophagus uses various procedures, including pedicled or free flap. Pharyngoplasty with free forearm flap provides excellent functional results. In radiation-related pharyngeal stenosis, recipient vascularization is often poor, especially in the venous system. The authors describe pharyngeal reconstruction with semi-free forearm flap, pedicled on the cephalic vein, to minimize the risk of venous thrombosis, which is the main factor of free forearm flap necrosis. Taking the case of a laryngectomy with complete pharyngeal stenosis after radiation therapy and iterative neck surgery, the technique of pharyngeal-esophageal reconstruction by semi-free forearm flap is described in a context of impaired vascularization.", "Title: NSFC spurs significant basic research progress of respiratory medicine in China\nContent: Over the years, research in respiratory medicine has progressed rapidly in China.

However, many of the remaining challenges in improving access to and appropriate use of medicines and services require pharmaceutical systems strengthening. Incorporating pharmaceutical systems strengthening into global health programmes requires recognition of a few ‘truths’. Systems strengthening is a lengthy and resource-intensive process that requires sustained engagement, which may not align with the short time frame for achieving targets in vertical-oriented programmes. Further, there is a lack of clarity on what key metrics associated with population and patient level outcomes should be tracked for systems strengthening interventions. This can hinder advocacy and communication with decision makers regarding health systems investments. Moving forward, it is important to find ways to balance the inherent tensions between the short-term focus on the efficiency of vertical programmes and broader, longer-term health and development objectives. Global health programme design should also shift away from a narrow view of medicines primarily as an input commodity to a more comprehensive view that recognizes the various structures and processes and their interactions within the broader health system that help ensure access to and appropriate use of medicines and related services.", "Title: Modification of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen by glycosylation\nContent: Abstract The SV40-encoded transforming protein, large tumor antigen (T-ag), is multifunctional. Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.", "Title: Effects of Defective Interfering Viruses on Virus Replication and Pathogenesis In Vitro and In Vivo\nContent: Defective interfering (DI) particles are subgenomic deletion mutants generated from the infectious virus genomes, generally by replicase errors. DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses. The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore. They proposed and defined the term “DI particle” to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both. Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes. Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments. DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature. Laboratory studies show that they can sometimes exert powerful disease-modulating effects (either attenuation or intensification of symptoms). Their role in nature remains largely unexplored, despite the recent suggestive evidence for their importance in a number of systems.", "Title: Synthesis and Bronchodilator Studies of Some Novel 6-Alkyl/Aryl-1,2,4-Triazino[4,3-c]Quinazolines.\nContent: A series of alkyl- and aryl-1,2,4-triazino[4,3-c]quinazolines (5a-h and 8a-h) were synthesized and characterized. The title compounds were evaluated for their in vivo bronchodilator activity on guinea pigs. All the test compounds exhibited good protection against histamine-induced bronchospasm. The structure-activity relationships based on the results obtained for these series were studied. Incorporation of an aryl ring with halo substitution to the theophylline bioisostere increases its potency. Among the compounds tested, 5b was found to be the most potent with 88.7% protection against histamine-induced bronchospasm compared to the standard compound aminophylline (87.8%).", "Title: Customised structural, optical and antibacterial characteristics of cinnamon nanoclusters produced inside organic solvent using 532 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG-pulse laser ablation\nContent: Biomedical values of organic natural cinnamon that are buried in their bulk counterpart can be exposed and customised via nanosizing. Based on this factor, a new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters (Cin-NCs) were synthesised using eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) approach. As-grown nontoxic Cin-NCs suspended in the citric acid of pH 4.5 (acted as organic solvent) were characterised thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical and bactericidal properties. The effects of various laser fluences (LF) at the fixed wavelength (532 nm) on the physiochemical properties of these Cin-NCs were determined. The FTIR spectra of the Cin-NCs displayed the symmetric-asymmetric stretching of the functional groups attached to the heterocyclic/cinnamaldehyde compounds. The HR-TEM image of the optimum sample revealed the nucleation of the crystalline spherical Cin-NCs with a mean diameter of approximately 10 ± 0.3 nm and lattice fringe spacing around 0.14 nm. In addition, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) and optical density (OD(600)) of the proposed Cin-NCs were measured to assess their antibacterial potency against the Staphylococcus aureus (IZD ≈ 24 mm) and Escherichia coli (IZD ≈ 25 mm) bacterial strains. The strong UV absorption (in the range of 269 and 310 nm) shown by these NCs was established to be useful for the antibacterial drug development and food treatment.", "Title: Dissecting the Contemporary Clerkship: Theory‐based Educational Trial of Videos Versus Lectures in Medical Student Education\nContent: BACKGROUND: Despite increasing use of the flipped classroom (FC) technique in undergraduate medical education, the benefit in learning outcomes over lectures is inconsistent. Best practices in preclass video design principles are rarely used, and it is unclear if videos can replace lectures in contemporary medical education. METHODS: We conducted a prospective quasi‐experimental controlled educational study comparing theory‐based videos to traditional lectures in a medical student curriculum. Medical students enrolled in an emergency medicine clerkship were randomly assigned to either a lecture group (LG) or a video group (VG). The slide content was identical, and the videos aligned with cognitive load theory‐based multimedia design principles. Students underwent baseline (pretest), week 1 (posttest), and end‐of‐rotation (retention) written knowledge tests and an observed structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessment. We compared scores between both groups and surveyed student attitudes and satisfaction with respect to the two learning methods. RESULTS: There were 104 students who participated in OSCE assessments (49 LG, 55 VG) and 101 students who participated in knowledge tests (48 LG, 53 VG). The difference in OSCE scores was statistically significant 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 0.23 to 2.35, t(102) = 2.43, p = 0.017), but the actual score difference was small from an educational standpoint (12.61 for LG, 11.32 for VG). All three knowledge test scores for both groups were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Videos based on cognitive load theory produced similar results and could replace traditional lectures for medical students. Educators contemplating a FC approach should devote their valuable classroom time to active learning methods.", "Title: Development of antiviral therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome\nContent: Abstract A new disease, the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged at the beginning of 2003 and rapidly spread throughout the world. Although the disease had disappeared in June 2003 its re-emergence cannot be excluded. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV may take years. Therefore, the availability of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV may be crucial for the control of future SARS outbreaks. In this review, experimental and clinical data about potential anti-SARS drugs is summarised and discussed. Animal model studies will be needed to help to determine which interventions warrant controlled clinical testing.", "Title: Renal denervation: effects on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmias.\nContent: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, atrial endocardial catheter ablation, mainly targeting focal discharges in the pulmonary veins, is the most widely used interventional treatment of drug-refractory AF. Despite technical improvements, results are not yet optimal. There is ongoing search for alternative and/or complementary interventional targets. Conditions associated with increased sympathetic activation such as hypertension, heart failure and sleep apnea lead to structural, neural and electrophysiological changes in the atrium thereby contributing to the progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF and increasing recurrence rate of AF after PVI. Until now, interventional modulation of autonomic nervous system was limited by highly invasive techniques. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) was introduced as a minimally invasive approach to reduce renal and whole body sympathetic activation with accompanying blood pressure control and left-ventricular morphological and functional changes in resistant hypertension. This review focuses on the potential atrial antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects of RDN in AF patients with hypertension, heart failure, and sleep apnea and discusses the possible role of RDN in the treatment of AF.", "Title: ‘The economy’ as if people mattered: revisiting critiques of economic growth in a time of crisis\nContent: Coronavirus (COVID-19) policy shut down the world economy with a range of government actions unprecedented outside of wartime. In this paper, economic systems dominated by a capital accumulating growth imperative are shown to have had their structural weaknesses exposed, revealing numerous problems including unstable supply chains, unjust social provisioning of essentials, profiteering, precarious employment, inequities and pollution. Such phenomena must be understood in the context of long standing critiques relating to the limits of economic systems, their consumerist values and divorce from biophysical reality. Critical reflection on the Coronavirus pandemic is combined with a review of how economists have defended economic growth as sustainable, Green and inclusive regardless of systemic limits and multiple crises–climate emergency, economic crash and pandemic. Instead of rebuilding the old flawed political economy again, what the world needs now is a more robust, just, ethical and equitable social-ecological economy.", "Title: Selective and Continuous Transarterial Heparin Infusion: Postmicrosurgical Therapy of Lower Leg Reconstruction for Cases with Recipient Artery Damage.\nContent: BACKGROUND Microsurgical lower extremity reconstruction is challenging because of high incidence of vascular thrombosis compared to microsurgical head and neck reconstruction. The risk of vascular pedicle thrombosis increases, if patients have arterial sclerosis or intimal dissection at the recipient artery. We performed selective and continuous transarterial heparin infusion for postoperative anticoagulant therapy. METHODS Fifteen patients (10 men and 5 women; mean age of 55.1 years; range of 16-86 years) received lower leg reconstruction using free flap. Postoperatively, a catheter was inserted into the femoral artery during surgery. Heparin infusion was performed through the catheter as a postoperative therapy for patients who had a risk factor of vascular pedicle thrombosis. Until two days post-operation, heparin was started between 5,000 and 10,000 IU per day. In postoperative days 3 and 4, half of the initial dose of heparin was administered. In postoperative days 5 and 6, 25% of the initial dose of heparin was administered. RESULTS Recipient arteries were the posterior tibial (n=11), anterior tibial (n=2), lateral circumflex femoral (n=1), and medial sural (n=1) arteries. Thirteen of the 15 cases showed arterial sclerosis or intimal dissection at the recipient artery. There was no case of vascular thrombosis. Hematoma formation at flap recipient was observed in four cases. Their initial heparin dose was than 8.5±1.7 U/kg/h. CONCLUSION Continuous transarterial heparin infusion was an effective anticoagulant therapy for the patients who had received free tissue transfer to a lower extremity. The initial dose of heparin should not exceed 6.5 U/kg/h.", "Title: Satisfaction with Care and Satisfaction with Decision Making are Similar Regardless of Staffing Model in a Neurocritical Care Unit\nContent: INTRODUCTION: Patient-centered care, particularly shared medical decision making, is difficult to measure in critically ill patients where decisions are often made by a designated surrogate, often receiving information from multiple providers with varying degrees of training. The purpose of this study was to compare short-term satisfaction with care and decision making in patients or surrogates between two neurocritical care units [one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and advanced practice providers (APPs) and one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and resident/fellow trainees] using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU) survey. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, the FS-ICU was administered on a tablet device to patients or surrogates at least 24 h after admission and stored on REDCap database. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four patients or surrogates completed the FS-ICU. The response rates were 59.97% and 46.58% in the APP and trainee units, respectively. There were no differences in patient age, sex, ventilator days or ICU length of stay. Overall, there were no differences in satisfaction with care or perceived shared medical making between the units. Respondents who identified their relationship with the patient as “other” (not a spouse, parent, nor a sibling) were less satisfied with care. Additionally, surrogates who identified as parents of the patient were more satisfied with degree of shared medical decision making. CONCLUSION: This study showed that: (1) collecting FS-ICU in a neurocritical care unit is feasible, (2) overall there is no difference in short-term satisfaction with care or shared decision making between a NICU staffed with trainees compared to one staffed with APPs, and (3) parents of patients have a higher short-term satisfaction with degree of shared medical decision making.", "Title: Guidance on Acute Management of Atrial Fibrillation in COVID-19.\nContent: Atrial fibrillation is a common clinical manifestation in hospitalized coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Medications used to treat atrial fibrillation such as antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants may have significant drug interactions with emerging COVID-19 treatments. Common unintended non-therapeutic target effects of COVID-19 treatment include IKr blockade, CYP450 isoenzyme inhibition or activation, and P-glycoprotein inhibition. Drug-drug interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants in these patients may lead to significant bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe bleeding. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these interactions, drug metabolism changes, and clinical consequences when choosing antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants for COVID-19 patients with atrial fibrillation. The objective of this review is to provide a practical guide for clinicians who are managing COVID-19 patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation.", "Title: The infection control audit: The standardized audit as a tool for change\nContent: BACKGROUND: Health care workers' compliance with infection control practices and principles is vital in preventing the spread of disease. One tool to assess infection control practice in clinical areas is the infection control audit; however, many institutions do not approach this in a systematic fashion. METHODS: Key features of the infection control audit were identified by the infection control team and developed into a standardized format for review of clinical areas. The audit incorporates a review of the physical layout, protocols and policies, knowledge of basic infection control principles, and workplace practice review. RESULTS: Over the last 13 years, the infection control unit has completed 17 audits involving 1525 employees. Four-hundred-one staff members have filled out questionnaires that assessed their understanding of standard precautions. A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% of these have been implemented. The majority of recommendations address separation of clean and dirty supplies, hand hygiene compliance, hand hygiene signage, proper use of barriers, and environmental cleaning. CONCLUSION: The infection control audit is an opportunity to implement changes and to introduce remedial measures in collaboration with various departments and services. A standardized approach to the audit allows benchmarking of practices across the institution and enhances standards of care.", "Title: The airborne transmission of infection between flats in high-rise residential buildings: Particle simulation\nContent: Abstract Several case clusters occurred in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong in the 2003 SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, which motivated a series of engineering investigations into the possible airborne transport routes. It is suspected that, driven by buoyancy force, the polluted air that exits the window of the lower floor may re-enter the immediate upper floor through the window on the same side. This cascade effect has been quantified and reported in a previous paper, and it is found that, by tracer gas concentration analysis, the room in the adjacent upstairs may contain up to 7% of the air directly from the downstairs room. In this study, after validation against the experimental data from literatures, Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are both adopted to numerically investigate the dispersion of expiratory aerosols between two vertically adjacent flats. It is found that the particle concentration in the upper floor is two to three orders of magnitude lower than in the source floor. 1.0μm particles disperse like gaseous pollutants. For coarse particles larger than 20.0μm, strong deposition on solid surfaces and gravitational settling effect greatly limit their upward transport.", "Title: Covid-19: Pandemonium in our time\nContent: While pandemonium has come to mean wild and noisy disorder, the reference here is to John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost and the upheaval following Lucifer's banishment from Heaven and his construction of Pandæmonium as his hub. Today's avalanche of conflicting news on how to deal with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) brings to mind the Trinity nuclear bomb test with Enrico Fermi estimating its strength by releasing small pieces of paper into the air and measuring their displacement by the shock wave. Fermi's result, in fact not far from the true value, emphasised his ability to make good approximations with few or no actual data. The current wave of Covid-19 presents just this kind of situation as it engulfs the world from ground zero in Wuhan, China. Much information is indeed missing, but datasets that might lead to useful ideas on how to handle this pandemic are steadily accumulating.", "Title: The business of making vaccines\nContent: With a growing need for better and more plentiful vaccines, traditional vaccine companies are responding by increasing manufacturing capacity, the biotech industry, with innovative products. Both are surely needed.", "Title: Cancer Surgery During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Turkey\nContent: The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has spread rapidly all over the world after its appearance in December 2019, soon became a pandemic. In many places struck by the epidemic, clinical branches have prepared new guidelines for approaching the management of the disease in their area during the pandemic. Surgeons have also delayed elective surgeries. The first case of Covid-19 in Turkey was detected on March 10, 2020. After this date, 39 patients with a diagnosis of cancer were operated on in our clinic. In this study, we wanted to reveal the results of the cancer surgeries that we have performed during this period.", "Title: Combination of radiofrequency ablation with transarterial chemoembolization for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: experience from a Danish tertiary liver center.\nContent: BACKGROUND Recent studies have shown that the combination of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may offer a survival advantage compared to monotherapy. PURPOSE To study the effectiveness of combination therapy with RFA and TACE compared to that of TACE alone in a Scandinavian tertiary liver cancer center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of the patients treated with combination therapy vis-à-vis TACE alone from June 2007 to November 2012 was performed. Eighteen patients were treated with a combination of RFA and TACE with an interval of 1-4 days between the treatments. For comparison, a group of 18 patients treated with TACE as monotherapy in the same time period was matched with the combination group by demographic data, tumor characteristics, biochemical and clinical parameters, and performance status (PS). RESULTS Each group consisted of 14 patients with cirrhosis and four without. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, tumor characteristics, causes of cirrhosis, levels of bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time, Child Pugh score, or World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median survival of patients in the RFA + TACE combination group was 586 days compared to 296 days in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). However, when we stratified the data for cirrhosis and WHO performance status, patients in the combination group had significantly better survival (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION Combination therapy with RFA and TACE for unresectable HCC, compared to TACE alone, may offer a survival benefit for a selected group of patients with HCC.", "Title: Retrieval study at 623 human mesh explants made of polypropylene--impact of mesh class and indication for mesh removal on tissue reaction.\nContent: Textile meshes frequently are implanted in the abdominal wall to reinforce a hernia repair. However, revisions for mesh associated complications confirm that these devices are not completely free of risk. Explanted devices offer an opportunity to define the impact of mesh structure on tissue response. This retrieval study analyses the tissue reaction to 623 polypropylene mesh samples (170 class 1 with large pores, and 453 class 2 with small pores) explanted for pain, infection, or recurrence. Histopathological assessment included morphometry of inflammatory infiltrate (IF) and connective tissue (CT), and of collagen 1/3 ratio. Half of the meshes were removed after more than 23 month. Despite large inter-individual differences removal for infection showed more IF than for pain or recurrence with significant correlation of IF with CT. Class 1 meshes with large pores showed less IF, CT, fistula formation, calcification, and bridging than class 2 meshes with small pores. Meshes removed for recurrence showed a lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in 70%. Large pore class 1 meshes showed an improved tissue response and may be considered as favorable to prevent inflammatory side effects. The presence of lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in most of the samples with recurrences stresses the relevance of an intact healing process. Late manifestation of complications demands long-lasting follow-up.", "Title: An optimized method for enumerating CNS derived memory B cells during viral-induced inflammation\nContent: Abstract Background CNS inflammation resulting from infection, injury, or neurodegeneration leads to accumulation of diverse B cell subsets. Although antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the inflamed CNS have been extensively examined, memory B cell (Bmem) characterization has been limited as they do not secrete antibody without stimulation. Moreover, unlike human Bmem, reliable surface markers for murine Bmem remain elusive. New method Using a viral encephalomyelitis model we developed a modified limiting dilution in vitro stimulation assay to convert CNS-derived virus specific Bmem into ASC. Comparison with existing methods Stimulation methods established for lymphoid tissue cells using prolonged stimulation with viral lysate resulted in substantial ASC loss and minimal Bmem to ASC conversion of CNS-derived cells. By varying stimulation duration, TLR activators, and culture supplements, we achieved optimal conversion by culturing cells with TLR7/8 agonist R848 in the presence of feeder cells for 2days. Results Flow cytometry markers CD38 and CD73 characterizing murine Bmem from lymphoid tissue showed more diverse expression patterns on corresponding CNS-derived B cell subsets. Using the optimized TLR7/8 stimulation protocol, we compared virus-specific IgG Bmem versus pre-existing ASC within the brain and spinal cord. Increasing Bmem frequencies during chronic infection mirrored kinetics of ASC. However, despite initially similar Bmem and ASC accumulation, Bmem prevailed in the brain, but were lower than ASC in the spinal cord during persistence. Conclusion Simultaneous enumeration of antigen-specific Bmem and ASC using the Bmem assay optimized for CNS-derived cells enables characterization of temporal changes during microbial or auto-antigen induced neuroinflammation.", "Title: Pathogenicity of turkey astroviruses in turkey embryos and poults.\nContent: The pathogenicity of turkey astrovirus 2001 (TAstV2001) and turkey astrovirus 1987 (TAstV1987) in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) turkey embryos and commercial poults was investigated. The virus shedding in poults was monitored using electron microscopy (EM) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the 14-day experimental period. Both viruses caused enteritis and growth depression in SPF turkey embryos and poults. The TAstV2001 did not induce macroscopic or microscopic lesions in thymuses and bursas of embryos or poults. No macroscopic changes were observed in thymuses and bursas of embryos and poults inoculated with TAstV1987, and no statistically significant differences in bursa weight/ body weight ratios (P > 0.05) were detected. However, TAstV1987 infection resulted in microscopic lesions in bursas but not in thymuses of infected embryos and poults. Both TAstV2001 and TAstV1987 were shed during the whole 14-day experimental period as detected by EM and RT-PCR. These findings indicated that both TAstV1987 and TAstV2001 are etiologic agents of turkey enteritis. In addition, TAstV1987 might cause impairment of the immune system of infected poults. The pathogenicity of TAstV1987 is somewhat different from TAstV2001.", "Title: Can we trust the prediction model? Demonstrating the importance of external validation by investigating the COVID-19 Vulnerability (C-19) Index across an international network of observational healthcare datasets\nContent: Background: SARS-CoV-2 is straining healthcare systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. Methods: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. Findings: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. Interpretation: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.", "Title: Comparison of broad-spectrum antiviral activities of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) and the eIF4A-inhibitor Silvestrol\nContent: Rocaglates, a class of natural compounds isolated from plants of the genus Aglaia, are potent inhibitors of translation initiation. They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.", "Title: Recommandations CCAFU sur la prise en charge des cancers de l’appareil urogénital en période d’épidémie au Coronavirus COVID-19\nContent: Résumé Objectif La population française est confrontée à la pandémie de COVID-19 et le système de santé a été réorienté en urgence pour la prise en charge des patients atteints du coronavirus. La prise en charge des cancers de l’appareil urinaire et génital masculin doit être adaptée à ce contexte. Matériel et méthode Un avis d’experts documenté par une revue de la littérature a été formulé par le Comité de Cancérologie de l’Association Française d’Urologie (CCAFU). Résultats La prise en charge médicale et chirurgicale des patients atteints de cancers de l’appareil urinaire et génital masculin doit être adaptée en modifiant les modalités de consultation, en priorisant les interventions en fonction du pronostic intrinsèque des cancers en tenant compte des comorbidités du patient. La protection des urologues vis-à-vis du COVID-19 doit être prise en considération. Conclusion Le CCAFU émet un avis d’experts quant aux mesures à prendre pour adapter la prise en charge des cancers de l’appareil urinaire et génital masculin au contexte de pandémie par COVID-19. Summary Aim The French population is facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the health system have been reoriented in emergency for the care of patients with coronavirus. The management of cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted to this context. Material and method An expert opinion documented by a literature review was formulated by the Cancerology Committee of the French Association of Urology (CCAFU). Results The medical and surgical management of patients with any cancers of the urinary and male genital tracts must be adapted by modifying the consultation methods, by prioritizing interventions according to the intrinsic prognosis of cancers, taking into account the patient's comorbidities. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 must be considered. Conclusion The CCAFU issues an expert opinion on the measure to be taken to adapt the management of cancers of the male urinary and genital tract to the context of pandemic by COVID-19.", "Title: Locus CauMT1 provides a higher resolution alternative to ribosomal gene sequencing for initial Candida auris genotyping\nContent: Prior to SARS-CoV-2, New York City was the epicenter for another recently emerged pathogen: Candida auris. .", "Title: COVID 19- Clinical Profile, Radiological Presentation, Prognostic Predictors, Complications and Outcome: A Perspective from the Indian Subcontinent.\nContent: Background Since December 2019, we have been facing one of the worst pandemics of human history. It originated from the Hubei province in China as a case of pneumonia, later named COVID-19.1 The causative pathogen, a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV 2). India reported its first case of COVID19, on 30th January 2020. We aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics, severity and prognosis, along with impact of age on outcome. Methods Cross sectional, observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 [RT-PCR]. Results We observed male predominance, mean age of 36 years, with less or no symptoms, majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams. Thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, raised LDH was common (>35%, p<0.05). Patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications (p<0.05). Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities. Discussion Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged ≥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans. Studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour.", "Title: Factors which influence concordance among measurements obtained by different pulse oximeters currently used in some clinical situations.\nContent: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To evaluate both concordance among those measurements obtained by three different pulse oximeters currently used by nursing professionals in hospital units and the factors which can influence this concordance. BACKGROUND Many models of wireless pulse oximeters in the present market do not offer possibility of calibration and, therefore, they do not ensure patients' safety in daily clinical practice. DESIGN This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The sample of patients (140) was selected from such hospital units, and all of them had to fulfil inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation. METHODS The instruments used to carry out this research were a monitor (calibrated), two models of portable wireless pulse oximeters (used for 3 years by the nursing staff, without being calibrated), a tympanic thermometer and a weather meter. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to establish the concordance, whereas the Landis-Koch criteria were used to interpret the results. RESULTS The concordance among the three devices was considered as \"good\" (CCC: 0.925 and 0.974 (95%)). The CCC (0.925) for saturation measures was regarded as \"very good\"/\"almost perfect,\" and the pulse measure was considered as \"very good\" CCC 0.974, providing in both cases a high level of concordance (CCC > 0.91). CONCLUSIONS The overall concordance as regards pulse and oxygen saturation among the three pulse oximeters analysed is considered as \"very good\" according to the Landis-Koch criteria. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE There exists a \"very good\" concordance among two wireless oximeters which have been used by the health staff for 3 years and which did not offer any possibility of calibration and one monitor which belongs to the healthcare institution. This aspect is of crucial importance in daily clinical practice, and it is also relevant to ensure patient's safety.", "Title: A left-to-right shunt via the ductus arteriosus is associated with increased regional cerebral oxygen saturation during neonatal transition.\nContent: BACKGROUND Oxygen delivery to the brain is dependent on cardiac output and arterial oxygen content. OBJECTIVES The study was designed to investigate the influence of a left-to-right shunt via the ductus arteriosus (DA) on regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the brain and peripheral tissue during postnatal transition. METHODS Nested case-control study. In term neonates after elective cesarian section, rSO2 of the brain and pre- and postductal peripheral tissue were measured 15 min after uncomplicated postnatal transition. Two groups were formed according to shunt flow characteristics via the DA: shunt group (with a left-to-right shunt), and nonshunt group (no shunt). RESULTS Of 80 infants, in 58 (72%) a left-to-right shunt was identified, and in 22 (28%) no flow was seen via the DA. The 22 infants formed the nonshunt group. They were matched with 22 newborn infants with a left-to-right shunt via the DA (shunt group). Infants in the nonshunt group had significantly lower cerebral rSO2 values and higher fractional tissue oxygen extraction and heart rate values. There were no significant differences in regard to peripheral rSO2 values. CONCLUSION During postnatal transition, term infants with a left-to-right shunt via the DA have significantly higher cerebral rSO2 values compared to infants without shunt flow.", "Title: Impact of the defect size, the mesh overlap and the fixation depth on ventral hernia repairs: a combined experimental and numerical approach.\nContent: BACKGROUND Ventral hernia repairs (VHRs) still exhibit clinical complications in terms of recurrence, pain, and discomfort. Factors such as surgical technique or mesh features are thought to be highly influent. The aim was to evaluate the impact of the defect size, the mesh overlap and the fixation depth on VHR using both physical and numerical models. METHODS The physical model was developed to mimic a passive abdominal wall. Healthy, damaged, and repaired configurations were evaluated using a spherical plunger. The associated numerical (Finite Elements) model was first loaded by a plunger for validation. A parametric study was then conducted with the numerical model loaded by a uniform pressure. Two defect sizes (3.5 × 5 cm and 8.25 × 12 cm elliptic shape), two overlaps (2 and 5 cm), and two fixation depths (peritoneum or muscle) were investigated for both passive and active abdominal walls. RESULTS With the physical model, the repaired configuration was 22 % stiffer than the damaged configuration. The statistical analysis of the parametric study showed that the defect size was the most influential parameter regarding the stress in the mesh, the bulging and the pull-out force at the fixation points. The overlap was influential in terms of stress in the mesh. The fixation depth was not influential. These trends increased with the abdominal wall activity. CONCLUSION Increase of the defect size and decrease of the overlap affected significantly the VHR mechanical performances. Such numerical models could help to better understand the behavior of the repaired abdominal wall and finally to reduce the clinical complications.", "Title: Management of severe traumatic brain injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome using pumped extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal device.\nContent: The effects of a high carbon dioxide on cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure are well known. We report the case of a man who presented after with a severe traumatic brain injury including intracranial and extradural haemorrhage. Neuroprotective ventilation was impossible without supramaximal tidal volumes due to a combination of chest trauma and severe bronchospasm. A pump driven Novalung iLA active® system was inserted to achieve both ARDSnet ventilation and a lowering of intracranial pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first time this system has been used to this effect. The patient went on to make a good recovery.", "Title: Ethical Concerns About Human Genetic Enhancement in the Malay Science Fiction Novels\nContent: Advancements in science and technology have not only brought hope to humankind to produce disease-free offspring, but also offer possibilities to genetically enhance the next generation’s traits and capacities. Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious. Association of the negative image of scientists as well as the private research companies with the research on human genetic enhancement reflects the authors’ concerns about the main motivations for conducting such research and the extent to which such research will benefit society.", "Title: Diabetes and covid-19: more than the sum of two morbidities\nContent: The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has caused a public health emergency worldwide. Risk, severity and mortality of the disease have been associated with non-communicable chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. Accumulated evidence has caused great concern in countries with high prevalence of this morbidity, such as Brazil. This text shows the picture of diabetes in Brazil, followed by epidemiological data and explanatory hypothesis for the association between diabetes and covid-19. We emphasized how the burden of these two morbidities in a middle-income country has aggravated this pandemic scenario. The comprehension of this association and biological plausibility may help face this pandemic and future challenges.", "Title: Defining Essential Services for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nContent: COVID-19 is a rapidly growing global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus. With no vaccine or definitive treatment, public health authorities have recommended a strategy of \"social distancing,\" reducing individual interaction, canceling elective procedures, and limiting nonessential services. Health care providers must determine what procedures are considered \"elective,\" balancing risk of treatment delays with that of coronavirus exposure to patient, family, and providers. Given critical periods for language development and the long-term impact of auditory deprivation, some audiologic and otologic services should be considered essential. In this article, we describe the experience of a quaternary referral pediatric hospital in Seattle, the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, and share strategies for risk minimization employed by Seattle Children's Hospital. We hope that this work can be a reference for other centers continuing care for children who are deaf and hard of hearing during the COVID-19 and future resource-limiting crises.", "Title: Cytoplasmic tails of hantavirus glycoproteins interact with the nucleocapsid protein.\nContent: Here we characterize the interaction between the glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of Puumala virus (PUUV; genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae). The interaction was initially established with native proteins by co-immunoprecipitating PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein with the glycoprotein complex. Mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the N protein has multiple binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Gn and is also able to bind to the predicted CT of Gc. The importance of Gn- and Gc-CTs to the recognition of RNP was further verified in pull-down assays using soluble peptides with binding capacity to both recombinant N protein and the RNPs of PUUV and Tula virus. Additionally, the N protein of PUUV was demonstrated to interact with peptides of Gn and Gc from a variety of hantavirus species, suggesting a conserved RNP-recognition mechanism within the genus. Based on these and our previous results, we suggest that the complete hetero-oligomeric (Gn-Gc)(4) spike complex of hantaviruses mediates the packaging of RNP into virions.", "Title: COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2 Infection: Pathophysiology and Clinical Effects on the Nervous System.\nContent: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome, with high potential of spreading and infecting humans worldwide. Since January 2020, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially, and extra respiratory symptoms including neurological symptoms are increasingly highlighted. These neurological disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from non-specific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurological symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factor, and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurological symptoms. Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurological involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we think providing an update for neurological complications of COVID-19 could be useful for physician and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurological aspects reported in the literature to date, including the evidence and pathways of the neuro-invasion in COVID-19, and the main neurological disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as the future perspectives and the potential long term consequence of current neuro-infection in COVID-19 patients.", "Title: Efficient adaptive designs for clinical trials of interventions for COVID-19\nContent: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented response in terms of clinical research activity. An important part of this research has been focused on randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential therapies for COVID-19. The results from this research need to be obtained as rapidly as possible. This presents a number of challenges associated with considerable uncertainty over the natural history of the disease and the number and characteristics of patients affected, and the emergence of new potential therapies. These challenges make adaptive designs for clinical trials a particularly attractive option. Such designs allow a trial to be modified on the basis of interim analysis data or stopped as soon as sufficiently strong evidence has been observed to answer the research question, without compromising the trial's scientific validity or integrity. In this paper we describe some of the adaptive design approaches that are available and discuss particular issues and challenges associated with their use in the pandemic setting. Our discussion is illustrated by details of four ongoing COVID-19 trials that have used adaptive designs.", "Title: Emergency Medical Services resource capacity and competency amid COVID-19 in the United States: Preliminary findings from a national survey\nContent: This study aimed to investigate available resources, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability, sanitation practices, institutional policies, and opinions among EMS professionals in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic using a self-report survey questionnaire. METHODS An online 42-question multiple choice survey was randomly distributed between April 1, 2020, and April 12, 2020 to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) paid personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=165). We approximate a 95% confidence interval (+/- 0.0755). RESULTS An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately [1/3] of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which pose as a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed.", "Title: Methyl-RNA: an evolutionary bridge between RNA and DNA?\nContent: Abstract Given the apparent limitation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes to about 30 kb, together with the complexity of DNA synthesis, it appears difficult for a dsRNA genome to encode all the information required before the transition from an RNA to a DNA genome. Ribonucleotide reductase itself, which synthesises deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, requires complex protein radical chemistry, and RNA world genomes may have reached their limits of coding capacity well before such complex enzymes had evolved. The transition from RNA to DNA thus appears to require intermediate steps, and we suggest that the naturally occurring 2′-O-methylated RNA, with chemical properties intermediate between RNA and DNA, is a suitable candidate.", "Title: Inspiratory effort and breathing pattern change in response to varying the assist level: A physiological study\nContent: AIM: To describe the response of breathing pattern and inspiratory effort upon changes in assist level and to assesss if changes in respiratory rate may indicate changes in respiratory muscle effort. METHODS: Prospective study of 82 patients ventilated on proportional assist ventilation (PAV+). At three levels of assist (20 %-50 %-80 %), patients' inspiratory effort and breathing pattern were evaluated using a validated prototype monitor. RESULTS: Independent of the assist level, a wide range of respiratory rates (16-35br/min) was observed when patients' effort was within the accepted range. Changing the assist level resulted in paired changes in inspiratory effort and rate of the same tendency (increase or decrease) in all but four patients. Increasing the level in assist resulted in a 31 % (8-44 %) decrease in inspiratory effort and a 10 % (0-18 %) decrease in respiratory rate. The change in respiratory rate upon the change in assist correlated modestly with the change in the effort (R = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Changing assist level results in changes in both respiratory rate and effort in the same direction, with change in effort being greater than that of respiratory rate. Yet, neither the magnitude of respiratory rate change nor the resulting absolute value may reliably predict the level of effort after a change in assist.", "Title: Seroprevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Healthcare Workers in Non-epidemic Region: A Report from Iwate Prefecture in Japan\nContent: Background: As of June 8, 2020, Iwate is the only one of 47 prefectures in Japan with no confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Serological survey for COVID-19 antibodies is crucial in area with low prevalence as well as epidemic area when addressing health and social issues caused by COVID-19. Rapid, accurate and easy-to-use antibody tests as well laboratory-based antibody tests are necessary for confirming immunity in a given community. Methods:Serum samples from healthcare workers (n = 1,000, mean 40 {+/-} 11 years) of Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, Iwate, Japan were tested for the prevalence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Two laboratory-based quantitative tests (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays) and one point-of-care (POC) qualitative test (Alfa Instant-view plus COVID-19 Test) were performed simultaneously. Sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 99.6% in Abbott assay; 100%, 99.8% in Roche assay; 97.8%, 94.6% in Alfa POC test, respectively. Results:The laboratory-based quantitative tests showed positive in 4 of 1,000 samples (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79): 4/1,000 (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79) in Abbott; 0/1,000 (0%) in Roche. Positive samples were not detected for both Abbott and Roche assays. The POC qualitative test showed positive in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41), showing higher rates than those of the laboratory-based quantitative tests. There were no samples with simultaneous positive reaction for two quantitative tests and a POC test. Conclusions: Infected COVID-2 cases were not confirmed by a retrospective serological study in healthcare workers of our hospital. The POC qualitative tests with lower specificity have the potential for higher false positive reactions than the laboratory-based quantitative tests in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19.", "Title: The dynamics of Chinese variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus production in Vero cells and intestines of 2-day old piglets.\nContent: A severe porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) epizootic has been affecting pigs of all ages that are characterized by high mortality among suckling piglets in China since late 2010, causing significant economic losses. Obtaining a current-circulating PEDV variant isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture is prerequisite for the development of efficient vaccines. In this study, PEDV strain HN1303 was isolated successfully on Vero cells with supplemental trypsin, and the isolate has been serially propagated in cell culture for over 95 passages. The infectious titers of the virus during the first 10 passages ranged from 10(2.6) to 10(5.8) 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml, and the titers of 20-95 passages ranged from 10(6.2) to 10(8.0)TCID50/ml. The growth curve of Vero cell-adapted HN1303 in cell culture was determined, and dynamics of virus production was confirmed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on spike gene indicate that the HN1303 strain belongs to genotype IIa. In addition, the fourth passage cell-culture HN1303 was subjected to 2-day old piglets. All piglets orally inoculated developed severe watery diarrhea and vomiting within 24 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and died within 72 hpi. The results of animal experiments reveal that this strain is highly pathogenic to 2-day old piglets.", "Title: An allosteric inhibitor of substrate recognition by the SCF(Cdc4) ubiquitin ligase.\nContent: The specificity of SCF ubiquitin ligase-mediated protein degradation is determined by F-box proteins. We identified a biplanar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4 using a fluorescence polarization screen to monitor the displacement of a fluorescein-labeled phosphodegron peptide. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full-length phosphorylated substrates by SCF(Cdc4). A co-crystal structure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts itself between the beta-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 A away from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive class of druggable target.", "Title: Surgical technique of laparoscopic hybrid approach for recurrent inguinal hernia: Report a case.\nContent: INTRODUCTION Currently, laparoscopic surgery (LS) is a widely accepted surgical treatment for inguinal hernias, and it has major advantages, especially for recurrent cases. PRESENTATION OF CASE We diagnosed the recurrent inguinal hernia after wound infection and performed the laparosocopic approach. We would like to introduce our method. We distinguished between the presence and absence of bilateral inguinal hernia with an intra-abdominal scope using the transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) technique, which we call laparoscopic examination. Thus, we can distinguish between the types of inguinal hernias and whether they are bilateral or not. We dissected the Retzius space on the inside of an epigastric arteriovenous fistula as part of TEP part A, and dissection was performed without a balloon. We separated and dissected the Retzius space. We also performed lateral dissection of the preperitoneal space. We made an incision in the peritoneum at the inner groin ring (hernia sac). We isolated the cord structures (parietalization) using TAPP. We finally checked this operation from the abdominal space (TAPP filed) and determined whether the repair was satisfactorily completed or not. DISCUSSION Our hybrid method is not special but the conventional laparoscopic approach adapted each merits both TAPP and TEP. CONCLUSION Our method is effective for difficult recurrent inguinal hernias.", "Title: Severe acute respiratory syndrome: report of treatment and outcome after a major outbreak.\nContent: BACKGROUND The outcome is reported of a prospective uncontrolled study based on a stepwise treatment protocol during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. METHOD One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low dose corticosteroid, and then intravenous high dose methylprednisolone according to responses. Sustained response to treatment was defined as (1) defervescence for > or =4 consecutive days, (2) resolution of lung consolidation by >25%, and (3) oxygen independence by the fourth day without fever. Patients with defervescence who achieved either criterion 2 or 3 were classified as partial responders. Patients who fell short of criteria 2 and 3 were non-responders. RESULTS Laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection was established in 132 (95.7%). None responded to antibiotics but 25 (18.1%) responded to ribavirin + low dose corticosteroid. Methylprednisolone was used in 107 patients, of whom 95 (88.8%) responded favourably. Evidence of haemolytic anaemia was observed in 49 (36%). A high level of C-reactive protein at presentation was the only independent predictor for use of methylprednisolone (odds ratio 2.18 per 10 mg/dl increase, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.25, p = 0.02). Thirty seven patients (26.8%) required admission to the intensive care unit and 21 (15.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were 15 deaths (mortality rate 10.9%), most with significant co-morbidities, whereas 122 (88.4%) had been discharged home 4 months after the outbreak onset. CONCLUSION The use of high dose pulse methylprednisolone during the clinical course of a SARS outbreak was associated with clinical improvement, but randomised controlled trials are needed to ascertain its efficacy in this condition.", "Title: Pre-oligodendrocytes from adult human CNS.\nContent: CNS remyelination and functional recovery often occur after experimental demyelination in adult rodents. This has been attributed to the ability of mature oligodendrocytes and/or their precursor cells to divide and regenerate in response to signals in demyelinating lesions. To determine whether oligodendrocyte precursor cells exist in the adult human CNS, we have cultured white matter from patients undergoing partial temporal lobe resection for intractable epilepsy. These cultures contained a population of process-bearing cells that expressed antigens recognized by the O4 monoclonal antibody, but these cells did not express galactocerebroside (a marker for oligodendrocytes), glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes), or vimentin. Selective elimination of O4-positive (O4+) cells by complement-mediated lysis resulted in inhibition of oligodendrocyte development in vitro. Since O4+ cells have an antigenic phenotype reminiscent of the rat adult oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte progenitor and appear to develop into oligodendrocytes rather than type 2 astrocytes with time in culture, we call them \"pre-oligodendrocytes.\" Neither pre-oligodendrocytes nor oligodendrocytes incorporated 3H-thymidine in response to rat astrocyte-conditioned medium, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). However, IGF-1 increased the relative abundance of oligodendrocytes to pre-oligodendrocytes, while bFGF had the opposite effect. Cells with the antigenic phenotype of pre-oligodendrocytes were also identified in tissue prints of adult human white matter. We propose that, in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, pre-oligodendrocytes may divide and/or migrate in response to signals present in demyelinated lesions and thus facilitate remyelination.", "Title: The Good of Patients and the Good of Society: Striking a Moral Balance\nContent: The relationship between the good of individual patients and the special good is examined when they are in conflict. The proposition is advanced that the ethical resolution of such conflicts requires an ethic of social medicine comparable to the existing ethic of clinical medicine. Comparing and contrasting the obligations clinicians incur under both aspects of the ethics of medicine is propadeutic to any ordering of priorities between them. The suggested partition of obligations between patient good and the common good is applicable beyond medicine to the other health professions.", "Title: The Influence of Meteorology on the Spread of Influenza: Survival Analysis of an Equine Influenza (A/H3N8) Outbreak\nContent: The influences of relative humidity and ambient temperature on the transmission of influenza A viruses have recently been established under controlled laboratory conditions. The interplay of meteorological factors during an actual influenza epidemic is less clear, and research into the contribution of wind to epidemic spread is scarce. By applying geostatistics and survival analysis to data from a large outbreak of equine influenza (A/H3N8), we quantified the association between hazard of infection and air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity, whilst controlling for premises-level covariates. The pattern of disease spread in space and time was described using extraction mapping and instantaneous hazard curves. Meteorological conditions at each premises location were estimated by kriging daily meteorological data and analysed as time-lagged time-varying predictors using generalised Cox regression. Meteorological covariates time-lagged by three days were strongly associated with hazard of influenza infection, corresponding closely with the incubation period of equine influenza. Hazard of equine influenza infection was higher when relative humidity was <60% and lowest on days when daily maximum air temperature was 20–25°C. Wind speeds >30 km hour(−1) from the direction of nearby infected premises were associated with increased hazard of infection. Through combining detailed influenza outbreak and meteorological data, we provide empirical evidence for the underlying environmental mechanisms that influenced the local spread of an outbreak of influenza A. Our analysis supports, and extends, the findings of studies into influenza A transmission conducted under laboratory conditions. The relationships described are of direct importance for managing disease risk during influenza outbreaks in horses, and more generally, advance our understanding of the transmission of influenza A viruses under field conditions.", "Title: Polygalasaponin F treats mice with pneumonia induced by influenza virus\nContent: BACKGROUND: Influenza is an acute viral respiratory illness that causes high morbidity and mortality globally. Therapeutic actions are limited to vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. Polygala (P.) japonica herba is rich in Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C(53)H(86)O(23)), used for acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections treatment in China. Hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. PSF was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. The action of PSF to alleviate pulmonary inflammation caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection requires careful assessment. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of PSF on mice with pneumonia caused by influenza H1N1 (A/FM/1/47). METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD(50)) of influenza virus. BALB/c mice were treated with PSF or oseltamivir (oral administration) for 2 h post-infection and received concomitant treatment for 5 days after infection. On day 6 post-infection, 10 mice per group were killed to collect related samples, measure body weight and lung wet weight, and detect the viral load, cytokine, prostaglandins, pathological changes, and cell pathway protein expression in the lungs. In addition, the survival experiments were carried out to investigate the survival of mice. The expression profile of cell pathway proteins was detected and analyzed using a broad pathway antibody array and confirmed the findings from the array by western blotting. RESULTS: Polygalasaponin F and oseltamivir can protect against influenza viral infection in mice. PSF and oseltamivir significantly relieved the signs and symptoms, reduced body weight loss, and improved the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Moreover, PSF efficiently decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus (p < 0.05–0.01). Oseltamivir had a similar effect to lung cytokine of PSF, but did not decrease the levels of TXA(2) and PGE(2). There was a twofold or greater increase in four cell pathway protein, namely NF-κB p65 (2.68-fold), I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) (2.56-fold), and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) (7.15-fold) assessed in the array induced by influenza virus. Western blotting showed that the expression of these proteins was significantly decreased in lung after influenza virus challenge in PSF and oseltamivir-treated mice (p < 0.05–0.01). CONCLUSION: Polygalasaponin F appears to be able to augment protection against IAV infection in mice via attenuation of pulmonary inflammatory responses. Its effect on IAV-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB expressions.", "Title: Analysis of Outbreak and Global Impacts of the COVID-19\nContent: Corona viruses are a large family of viruses that are not only restricted to causing illness in humans but also affect animals such as camels, cattle, cats, and bats, thus affecting a large group of living species The outbreak of Corona virus in late December 2019 (also known as COVID-19) raised major concerns when the outbreak started getting tremendous While the first case was discovered in Wuhan, China, it did not take long for the disease to travel across the globe and infect every continent (except Antarctica), killing thousands of people Since it has become a global concern, different countries have been working toward the treatment and generation of vaccine, leading to different speculations While some argue that the vaccine may only be a few weeks away, others believe that it may take some time to create the vaccine Given the increasing number of deaths, the COVID-19 has caused havoc worldwide and is a matter of serious concern Thus, there is a need to study how the disease has been propagating across continents by numbers as well as by regions This study incorporates a detailed description of how the COVID-19 outbreak started in China and managed to spread across the globe rapidly We take into account the COVID-19 outbreak cases (confirmed, recovered, death) in order to make some observations regarding the pandemic Given the detailed description of the outbreak, this study would be beneficial to certain industries that may be affected by the outbreak in order to take timely precautionary measures in the future Further, the study lists some industries that have witnessed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on a global scale", "Title: Image Analysis Enhanced Event Detection from Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams\nContent: Events detected from social media streams often include early signs of accidents, crimes or disasters. Therefore, they can be used by related parties for timely and efficient response. Although significant progress has been made on event detection from tweet streams, most existing methods have not considered the posted images in tweets, which provide richer information than the text, and potentially can be a reliable indicator of whether an event occurs or not. In this paper, we design an event detection algorithm that combines textual, statistical and image information, following an unsupervised machine learning approach. Specifically, the algorithm starts with semantic and statistical analyses to obtain a list of tweet clusters, each of which corresponds to an event candidate, and then performs image analysis to separate events from non-events—a convolutional autoencoder is trained for each cluster as an anomaly detector, where a part of the images are used as the training data and the remaining images are used as the test instances. Our experiments on multiple datasets verify that when an event occurs, the mean reconstruction errors of the training and test images are much closer, compared with the case where the candidate is a non-event cluster. Based on this finding, the algorithm rejects a candidate if the difference is larger than a threshold. Experimental results over millions of tweets demonstrate that this image analysis enhanced approach can significantly increase the precision with minimum impact on the recall.", "Title: Relationships between duplex findings and quality of life in long-term follow-up of patients treated for chronic venous disease.\nContent: OBJECTIVE Relationships between duplex findings and data on health-related quality of life (QoL) to assess long-term results of treatment of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are not well known. The goal of this review was to correlate duplex findings and QoL assessments in clinical studies with long-term follow-up. METHODS A review of the English language literature on PUBMED revealed 17 clinical studies, including 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 prospective, and 2 retrospective studies that included patients with at least 5-year follow-up after endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), and traditional superficial venous surgery. RESULTS At 5 years, great saphenous vein (GSV) occlusion rate on duplex ultrasound ranged from 66% to 82% for EVLA, from 62% to 92% for RFA, from 41% to 58% for UGFS and from 54% to 85% for surgery. Freedom from GSV reflux rates were 82% and 84%, respectively for EVLA and surgery, and ranged between 84% and 95% for RFA. Significant improvements were observed in several domains of generic QoL and in most domains of venous disease-specific QoL, irrespective of the treatment. In at least one RCT, CIVIQ scores correlated well with abnormal duplex findings in patients who underwent treatment with UGFS. In another RCT, long-term AVVQ was significantly better after surgery as compared with UGFS similar to results of duplex findings. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the available literature confirmed that all four techniques were effective in the abolishment of reflux or obliteration of the GSV. Moreover, well-designed RCTs with large sample size are needed to produce robust long-term data on clinical outcome after treatment of varicose veins and CVI and to better understand the relationships between duplex-derived data and QoL assessments.", "Title: Characterization of SETD1A haploinsufficiency in humans and Drosophila defines a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome\nContent: Defects in histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are major contributing factors in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as loss-of-function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.", "Title: Accessory protein 5a is a major antagonist of the antiviral action of interferon against murine coronavirus.\nContent: The type I interferon (IFN) response plays an essential role in the control of in vivo infection by the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). However, in vitro, most strains of MHV are largely resistant to the action of this cytokine, suggesting that MHV encodes one or more functions that antagonize or evade the IFN system. A particular strain of MHV, MHV-S, exhibited orders-of-magnitude higher sensitivity to IFN than prototype strain MHV-A59. Through construction of interstrain chimeric recombinants, the basis for the enhanced IFN sensitivity of MHV-S was found to map entirely to the region downstream of the spike gene, at the 3' end of the genome. Sequence analysis revealed that the major difference between the two strains in this region is the absence of gene 5a from MHV-S. Creation of a gene 5a knockout mutant of MHV-A59 demonstrated that a major component of IFN resistance maps to gene 5a. Conversely, insertion of gene 5a, or its homologs from related group 2 coronaviruses, at an upstream genomic position in an MHV-A59/S chimera restored IFN resistance. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus gene product that can protect that same virus from the antiviral state induced by IFN. Neither protein kinase R, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2, nor oligoadenylate synthetase, which activates RNase L, was differentially activated in IFN-treated cells infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-S. Thus, the major IFN-induced antiviral activities that are specifically inhibited by MHV, and possibly by other coronaviruses, remain to be identified.", "Title: An ‘Arms Race’ between the Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay Pathway and Viral Infections\nContent: The Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) pathway is an RNA quality control pathway conserved among eukaryotic cells. While historically thought to predominantly recognize transcripts with premature termination codons, it is now known that the NMD pathway plays a variety of roles, from homeostatic events to control of viral pathogens. In this review we highlight the reciprocal interactions between the host NMD pathway and viral pathogens, which have shaped both the host antiviral defense and viral pathogenesis.", "Title: A recombinant DNA and vaccinia virus prime–boost regimen induces potent long-term T-cell responses to HCV in BALB/c mice\nContent: Abstract To explore the best prime–boost regimen and evaluate the T-cellular response memory against HCV, we constructed two DNA vaccine candidates (pVRC-CE1E2 and pAAV-CE1E2) and two recombinant viruses (rTTV-E1E2 and rAAV-E1E2) and then assessed the immune response to different prime–boost patterns in BALB/c mice. The rTTV-E1E2 boosted the immune response to HCV DNA vaccine prime significantly, and the inverted terminal repeat sequence harboring DNA construct PAAV-CE1E2 was the best prime agent in this study. Our study provides new information for both the prime–boost regimen and long-term T-cell response for HCV vaccine development.", "Title: The Impact of Host-Based Early Warning on Disease Outbreaks\nContent: Objective: The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation.", "Title: Exercise against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): Does workout intensity matter? (A mini review of some indirect evidence related to obesity)\nContent: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new virus causing respiratory illness outbreak. Nowadays, COVID-19 has spread to several countries around the world and is presently a major global concern. It appears that no certain effective pharmaceutical agent is currently available for it. It seems that obesity is one of the biggest risk factors related to COVID-19 hospitalization and critical illness. The strengthening of the body systems by non-drug ways is very important especially in obese people. On the basis of some indirect evidence, it seems that moderate physical activity can be recommended as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and viable way to cope with corona. On the other hand, recommending higher intensity exercise needs further consideration to make final decision in this regard.", "Title: A Mathematical Framework for Predicting Lifestyles of Viral Pathogens\nContent: Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size, viral pathogens enjoy very different, usually well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.", "Title: Covid-19 Epidemiological Factor Analysis: Identifying Principal Factors with Machine Learning\nContent: Based on a subset of Covid-19 Wave 1 cases at a time point near TZ+3m (April, 2020), we perform an analysis of the influencing factors for the epidemics impacts with several different statistical methods. The consistent conclusion of the analysis with the available data is that apart from the policy and management quality, being the dominant factor, the most influential factors among the considered were current or recent universal BCG immunization and the prevalence of smoking.", "Title: Posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release successfully addresses recurrent ventral hernias following anterior component separation.\nContent: PURPOSE Anterior component separation (ACS) with external oblique release for ventral hernia repair has a recurrence rate up to 32%. Hernia recurrence after prior ACS represents a complex surgical challenge. In this context, we report our experience utilizing posterior component separation with transversus abdominis muscle release (PCS/TAR) and retromuscular mesh reinforcement. METHODS Patients with a history of recurrent hernia following ACS repaired with PCS/TAR were retrospectively identified from prospective databases collected at two large academic institutions. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics (using CT scan) and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with a history of ACS developed 22 (76%) midline, 3 (10%) lateral and 4 (14%) concomitant recurrences. Contamination was present in 11 (38%) of cases. All were repaired utilizing a PCS/TAR with retromuscular mesh placement (83% synthetic, 17% biologic) and fascial closure. Wound morbidity consisted of 13 (45%) surgical site occurrences including 8 (28%) surgical site infections. Five (17%) patients required 90-day readmission, and two (7%) were related to wound morbidity. One organ space infection with frank spillage of stool resulted in the only instance of mesh excision. This case also represents the only instance of recurrence (3%) with a mean follow-up of 11 (range 3-36) months. CONCLUSION Patients with a history of an ACS who develop a recurrence represent a challenging clinical scenario with limited options for surgical repair. A PCS/TAR hernia repair achieves acceptable outcomes and may in fact be the best approach available.", "Title: Comparative analysis of laboratory indexes of severe and non-severe patients infected with COVID-19\nContent: BACKGROUND: The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has threaten the global health. The characteristics of laboratory findings of coronavirus are of great significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. We found indicators that may most effectively predict a non-severe COVID-19 patient develop into a severe patient. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the laboratory findings of severe patients with non-severe patients with COVID-19 from searched articles. RESULTS: Through the analysis of laboratory examination information of patients with COVID-19 from 35 articles (5912 patients), we demonstrated that severe cases possessed higher levels of leukocyte (1.20-fold), neutrophil (1.33-fold), CRP (3.04-fold), PCT (2.00-fold), ESR (1.44-fold), AST (1.40-fold), ALT (1.34-fold), LDH (1.54-fold), CK (1.44-fold), CK-MB (1.39-fold), total bilirubin (1.14-fold), urea (1.28-fold), creatine (1.09-fold), PT (1.03-fold) and D-dimer (2.74-fold), as well as lower levels of lymphocytes (1.44-fold), eosinophil (2.00-fold), monocyte (1.08-fold), Hemoglobin (1.53-fold), PLT (1.15-fold), albumin (1.15-fold), and APTT (1.02-fold). Lymphocyte subsets and series of inflammatory cytokines were also different in severe cases with the non-severe ones, including lower levels of CD4 T cells (2.10-fold) and CD8 T cells (2.00-fold), higher levels of IL-1ß (1.02-fold), IL-6 (1.93-fold) and IL-10 (1.55-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Some certain laboratory inspections could predict the progress of the COVID-19 changes, especially lymphocytes, CRP, PCT, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer, CD4 T cells and IL6, which provide valuable signals for preventing the deterioration of the disease.", "Title: An immunofluorescence test for detection of serum antibody to rodent coronaviruses.\nContent: An indirect immunofluorescence test, using cultured cells infected with two strains of mouse hepatitis virus, was developed for detection of antibody to rodent coronaviruses. The immunofluorescence test detected serum antibody to mouse hepatitis virus and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus earlier than the neutralization test. In the case of mouse hepatitis virus, the results of the immunofluorescence test closely paralleled those obtained with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", "Title: Applying Palliative Care Principles to Communicate With Children About COVID-19\nContent: Children are seeing rapid changes to their routines and facing an unpredictable future. Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skill sets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus. Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community building, recognition of death as a part of the life cycle, and legacy.", "Title: ELL Protein-associated Factor 2 (EAF2) Inhibits Transforming Growth Factor β Signaling through a Direct Interaction with Smad3.\nContent: A series of in vitro and in vivo studies has shown that EAF2 can affect multiple signaling pathways involved in cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects have remained elusive. Here we report the discovery of a new functional link between EAF2 and TGF-β signaling. Promoter reporter assays indicated that EAF2 suppresses Smad3 transcriptional activity, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. In addition, we observed that EAF2 binding does not alter Smad3 phosphorylation but causes Smad3 cytoplasmic retention, competes with Smad4 for binding to Smad3, and prevents p300-Smad3 complex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EAF2 suppresses both TGF-β-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and TGF-β-induced cell migration. This study identifies and characterizes a novel repressor of TGF-β signaling.", "Title: Clinical determinants of the severity of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): a systematic review and meta-analysis\nContent: BACKGROUND: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. RESULTS: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%. The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively. These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases. We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS. In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in studies with other types of designs. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity for the risk of death and severe manifestations was substantially high among the studies, and varying study designs was one of the underlying reasons for this heterogeneity. A statistical estimation of the risk of MERS death and identification of risk factors must be conducted, particularly considering the study design and potential biases associated with case detection and diagnosis.

Good outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of SARS symptoms. Poor outcome was defined as death or hospitalization beyond 22 days. A higher day-22 discharge rate was observed among patients who were given convalescent plasma before day 14 of illness (58.3% vs 15.6%; P<0.001) and among those who were PCR positive and seronegative for coronavirus at the time of plasma infusion (66.7% vs 20%; P=0.001).", "Title: The role of infections in the emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs): Compelling needs for novel strategies in the developing world\nContent: Summary The emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) follows multiple aetiological pathways requiring recognition for effective control and prevention. Infections are proving to be conventional, emerging and re-emerging aetiological factors for many NCDs. This review explores the possible mechanisms by which infections induce NCDs citing examples of studies in Africa and elsewhere where NCDs and infections are proposed or confirmed to be causally linked and also discusses the implications and challenges of these observations for science and medicine. The need to re-evaluate and expand early community and individual preventive and control strategies that will lead to reduction and even elimination of NCDs especially in Africa and other developing countries where infections are prevalent is highlighted.", "Title: Asthma in the elderly: what we know and what we have yet to know\nContent: In the past, asthma was considered mainly as a childhood disease. However, asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly nowadays. In addition, the burden of asthma is more significant in the elderly than in their younger counterparts, particularly with regard to mortality, hospitalization, medical costs or health-related quality of life. Nevertheless, asthma in the elderly is still been underdiagnosed and undertreated. Therefore, it is an imperative task to recognize our current challenges and to set future directions. This project aims to review the current literature and identify unmet needs in the fields of research and practice for asthma in the elderly. This will enable us to find new research directions, propose new therapeutic strategies, and ultimately improve outcomes for elderly people with asthma. There are data to suggest that asthma in older adults is phenotypically different from young patients, with potential impact on the diagnosis, assessment and management in this population. The diagnosis of AIE in older populations relies on the same clinical findings and diagnostic tests used in younger populations, but the interpretation of the clinical data is more difficult. The challenge today is to encourage new research in AIE but to use the existing knowledge we have to make the diagnosis of AIE, educate the patient, develop a therapeutic approach to control the disease, and ultimately provide a better quality of life to our elderly patients.", "Title: The ADAM metalloproteinases\nContent: Abstract The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) are a fascinating family of transmembrane and secreted proteins with important roles in regulating cell phenotype via their effects on cell adhesion, migration, proteolysis and signalling. Though all ADAMs contain metalloproteinase domains, in humans only 13 of the 21 genes in the family encode functional proteases, indicating that at least for the other eight members, protein–protein interactions are critical aspects of their biological functions. The functional ADAM metalloproteinases are involved in “ectodomain shedding” of diverse growth factors, cytokines, receptors and adhesion molecules. The archetypal activity is shown by ADAM-17 (tumour necrosis factor-α convertase, TACE), which is the principal protease involved in the activation of pro-TNF-α, but whose sheddase functions cover a broad range of cell surface molecules. In particular, ADAM-17 is required for generation of the active forms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ligands, and its function is essential for the development of epithelial tissues. Several other ADAMs have important sheddase functions in particular tissue contexts. Another major family member, ADAM-10, is a principal player in signalling via the Notch and Eph/ephrin pathways. For a growing number of substrates, foremost among them being Notch, cleavage by ADAM sheddases is essential for their subsequent “regulated intramembrane proteolysis” (RIP), which generates cleaved intracellular domains that translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. Several ADAMs play roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function, potentially by effecting maturation of sperm and their adhesion and migration in the uterus. Other non-catalytic ADAMs function in the CNS via effects on guidance mechanisms. The ADAM family are thus fundamental to many control processes in development and homeostasis, and unsurprisingly they are also linked to pathological states when their functions are dysregulated, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease. This review will provide an overview of current knowledge of the human ADAMs, discussing their structure, function, regulation and disease involvement.", "Title: Efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol in adult patients with mild/moderate COVID-19: an exploratory randomized controlled trial\nContent: Abstract Background Antiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. Methods Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoint, the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, was similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical (P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. Conclusions LPV/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care.

They are coordinates associated with each word in a dictionary, inferred from statistical properties of these words in a large corpus. In this paper we introduce the notion of “concept” as a list of words that have shared semantic content. We use this notion to analyse the learnability of certain concepts, defined as the capability of a classifier to recognise unseen members of a concept after training on a random subset of it. We first use this method to measure the learnability of concepts on pretrained word embeddings. We then develop a statistical analysis of concept learnability, based on hypothesis testing and ROC curves, in order to compare the relative merits of various embedding algorithms using a fixed corpora and hyper parameters. We find that all embedding methods capture the semantic content of those word lists, but fastText performs better than the others."], "title": ["Within host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in humans: Modeling immune responses and antiviral treatments", "EcoSoft: Proposition of an Eco-Label for Software Sustainability", "Estimating human-to-human transmissibility of hepatitis A virus in an outbreak at an elementary school in China, 2011", "Developing an Ethics Framework for Allocating Remdesivir in the COVID-19 Pandemic", "Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public.", "Grape juice increases the BDNF levels but not alter the S100B levels in hippocampus and frontal cortex from male Wistar Rats.", "Total laparoscopic sigmoid and rectal surgery in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery: a preliminary evaluation in China.", "Single-incision laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection: technical aspects and potential benefits.", "Association of classroom ventilation with reduced illness absence: a prospective study in California elementary schools", "Mustelids", "The Never‐ending Shift: A feminist reflection on living and organizing academic lives during the coronavirus pandemic", "Suppression of NK cells and regulatory T lymphocytes in cats naturally infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus", "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease is rare in children: An update from Saudi Arabia", "[Scenario-based study of medical resource requirement rapid assessment under the COVID-19 pandemic]", "Vasculitides: F.
