{"content": ["Question: Three years ago I was diagnosed with a very small carcinoid tumor which was found accidentally near the end of my small intestine duriing a colonoscopy. Sugery was reccommended, but I passed. About three weeks ago I had a very bad cold, and a little sinus infection. After the cold got better I noticed a dull aching pain on my right side under my ribcage. I had a ct scan a couple of days ago and the radiologist said they saw some spots on my liver. I am a 60 year old black female. I have no carcinoid syndrome symptons, in general good health, and feels good most of the time. I am on a very low dose of Lotrel for high blood pressure, and 50,000 mg of Vitamine D. I supplement with garlic with parsley seed oil gel caps for my hot flashes (menopause). Over the last couple of years I started to develope small bumps (boils) around my genitile area that would develop one after the other and get really sore and then errupt and heal. I seem to have solved that problem with daily doses of 1000 mg of vitamine C and alcohol rubs. Could all of these issues be related? Right now I am mostly concerned with the spots on my liver. I am due to see an oncologist later this month. Any idea as to what I can expect?\nAnswer: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. In most cases these spots are benign growths such as cysts or hematomas. Hematoma is very small and this can't cause such symptoms unless larger than 10 cm. You should do MRI scan or liver biopsy to find what type of lesion it is.  Less common this may be malignant issues such as hepatocellular carcinoma. This abdominal pain may not be related to liver spots at all. It may always be sign of some other issues such as IBD or gastritis. If these are just simple liver cysts then I don't think this is causing any symptoms. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.", "Question: Hi I recently received the depo-provera shot on October 9th. By the 12th I started feeling tired and now I can t even go to school with out feeling sick and very very tired. I used to workout (run and strength train) at least 4 times a week and now I can t even get through a 20 minute run which used to be a breeze. My resting heart rate was 72 and is now 87-95. I feel depressed and I m very put of breath and have flu like body aches. I sleep on a heating pad every night because of back pain that started last week. I m 18 years old, 5 6 , 126 lbs and I have low protein s (why I got the depo vs. the pill). I received the shot in my right buttocks . I called my nurse who administered the shot and she told me no one has ever felt like this, which I know is a lie because looking online and talking to friends who got the shot told me they felt the same way. Is this from the shot or could it be something else (mono, the nurse suggested) thank you!!\nAnswer: Hi CassctiexxThanks for writing in to Chat Doctor ! The change of mood, depression, lack of concentration can be expected with Depot Proverb, but the other things like feeling red and unwell and fast heart rate are unexpected sequela.

At times, features of a disease on an X-ray and CT scan is not characteristic and obvious to the eyes years before it manifests in to a disease that could be hurting. I guess unfortunately such an incident has occurred with you. The dark spot which you questioned was probably looking more normal and acceptable on the X-ray and CT scan earlier. Many doctors choose to follow up such findings and this is subjective. Therefore, any such normal findings might be passed as harmless. The patient is usually cautioned to follow up with the doctor. Many medicines are initially discovered for treatment on one disease condition and are later found to help in other conditions. There are clinical trials at multiple levels before a medicine for cancer might be implemented for regular use in patients. The topic about scrubbing before surgery is a time tested practice and confirmed to reduce chances of infection. There are many arguments in medicine and most are sorted out with research and evidence based medicine followed in modern day.

According to your symptoms this looks as acute lumbar muscle sprain in your lower back. Most probably due to bad posture or sudden jerk. Another differential diagnosis can be lumbar disc bulge leading to sudden onset of pain. Intervertebral disc compresses spinal cord and leads to lower back pain. When such patient comes to our hospital we usually do x-ray to rule out any nerve compression. MRI spine will show any disc bulge is there or not. And when muscle sprain is confirmed muscle relaxant, analgesic and neurotrophic medication can be started. Till time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back. You can consult physiotherapist for help. Physiotherapy like ultrasound and inferential therapy will give quick relief. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries.

So let s say you did something involving a lot of movement, like cleaning a room for a couple of hours, or marching band practice for a while. You feel fine. You get home or get to a stopping point and take a seat, just to have a break. You feel fine. You need to stand back up, but once you move to stand up, you get this strong pain in your lower back, like in the small of your back and your hips. It s so bad it knocks the breath out of you and something as simple as standing up takes a few minutes because it hurts so much. Trying to walk is difficult and you almost drop to the floor because of pain when you take even a single step unless you re grabbing something for support. After a few minutes of limping, the pain starts to alleviate and you can walk normally again and the pain is nearly gone entirely. Like literally walking it off. That s basically what happens to me and I ve been dealing with this since I was 15 and now that I m 19, I m kind of tired of it and want to know what it is so I can get it treated. I ve been confirmed to have a mild degree of scoliosis, but that s about it.\nAnswer: Hi, The symptoms in your message are highly suggestive of an ankylosing spondylitis. This is a condition that comes in 2nd to 3rd decade of life and progresses gradually.  The pain typically presents at rest or in the morning and improves with the mobility initially. As the condition progresses, the pain becomes constant.  I would recommend testing serum HLA B27. Let us know the reports, and we may be able to help you further. Hope I have answered your query.

I followed my doctors orders and still have some discomfort. today is my 21st birthday and i want to have a beer, would that significantly slow my healing progress?\nAnswer: Hello, I understand your concern about recovery. Single time consumption of beer has no effect on healing process of liver laceration. But you must be careful not to fall down under effect of alcohol as this is the bigger risk factor for not healing liver laceration. Alcohol consumption on regular basis is surely compromising liver function and over the time it may lead to end-stage of liver disease.", "Question: hi docs!i am Saugat from Nepal.My father is of 53 yrs.From last 3 yrs he has been suffering from high rate palpation about 120 per minute.My father does have Br. asthma too.He has visited many doctors but none of them and none of their medicine can cure palpation.At beginning of this,my father first consulted a local doctor and he prescribed medicine like Lorel 1 mg & Inderal 10mg for 2 yrs.But it didnt suit so my father left it and consulted Dr.Raut,one of the top heart specialist of country.Then he priscribed medicine like Dilcontin 90 mg & Calaptin 120 mg but this two medicine lead to high rate pulpation,extreme chest burn,back burn,dizziness,aasthma.etc.So after 3 month of their use doctor told to leave it and began to use Zapiz 0.5 mg from last 4 month and still continuing.But my fathers high pulpation has not been cure yet.The trend is continuing.Now my father is getting harrased and me too..please!!i request u to tell me what to do to cure this high pulpation?????\nAnswer: First do u have any ECG report.

What is your recommendations over this Is there any treatment available at haldwani / Moradabad / bareily etc Waiting for your promptly reply .. Thanks & regards Pankaj kumar singh Mob:- 0000\nAnswer: Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Pain in the legs can occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin. Leg pain can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or exercising, depending upon the cause(an in jury or a chronic disease.) Since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain. In your fathers case, in my opinion the cause can be Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes). This is a common cause of leg pain in diabetics. Anyway my recommendation for you is to consult his doctor because for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it is important to differentiate the exact type and location of his pain in the leg. Apart Diabetes other potential causes of leg pain are:Peripheral artery disease, Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), arthritis conditions, The pain of sciatica (from disc disease of the spine). All these alternatives should be taken in consideration for the right diagnosis and only after the right diagnosis your father can have the right treatment. Hope this is helpful.

I also wear a wrap to secure the ankle and help with the swelling. I originally had an xray that showed no break and I iced it and kept off the foot for a week. However, the ankle swells quite a bit each day and if I stand too long or walk to much, the swelling increases and the leg hurts. I ve also noticed a little bit of tingling in the top of the foot, along with a little pain above the heal and quite a bit of tightness from the heel to the calf. Another item I ve notice is that the leg seems to be cold to the touch. Is this normal for a sprain? I did not have an MRI but I have called by family doctor to look again at the xrays. I m not thinking that the sprain was more than a stretch of the legaments.\nAnswer: Hello, Thanks for writing to us, I have studied your case with diligence. As per your history and injury pattern there can be tear in ankle ligament leading to pain and swelling. Instability may increase due to laxity of ligament. I will advise doing MRI ankle for soft tissue involvement. Till time, you can continue use supportive splint or brace. Physiotherapy like ultrasound and TENS will help in early healing. Persistent pain after ankle injury is common and may take 6 months to heal. Hope this answers your query.

As semen analysis shows liquefaction time 1 hour is abnormal, motility is normal, morphology is below normal. Count 53 million/ml ? Then is normal (20 million/ml) should be at least.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that due to traumatic injury there has been inflammation of the soft tissues and there is accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells in the area leading to swelling. The bruising is due to ruptured blood vessels leading to Hematoma formation. I would suggest you to do alternate warm and cool compresses over the swelling. Take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen. Apply an analgesic gel containing Diclofenac. Apply heparin gel for faster disruption of hematoma. Elevate your leg while lying down. Avoid putting excessive pressure over the knee until it heals well. In case of no improvement in a week consult an Orthopedic and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

They'll just have to be injected in a different spot - for example, the right arm for the vaccine, the left arm for the immunoglobulin. The immunoglobulin may indeed affect antibody production and it's not recommended 7 days or later after initiation of vaccination, like in your case! The immunoglobulin is not recommended to patients with a prior history of vaccination as well. Regarding your second question: transmission occurs through saliva. Contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected animal is not supposed to result in transmission. Coming into contact with a potentially infected dog can be dangerous if you have a scratch because the virus may be inoculated through its saliva. I hope I've answered your questions.

Last two days he vomitted the mucus also couple of times...But he is taking food and all and not vomitting the same. I have consulted a doctor yday and he adviced for Zyrtec only. I am giving 9 drops for him...But since i noticed some kitch kitch in the morning and he is getting the temtation again for vomitting, can i give aAsthalis also..previously my doctor has prescribed him for the same. He is aged 1.5 yrs. Thanks in advnce, manoj\nAnswer: Your child is suffering from a respiratory tract infection which is likely to be caused by a virus. As he is trying to cough out the thick mucus, the gag is triggering a vomiting but not otherwise. Zyrtec (cetirizine) is an antiallergic which relieves the allergic component of such infections and should be given for a few days to relieve the khitch. Give him steam inhalation or nebulization if possible. The water in the form of vapor or fine particles will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough and give him relief. Stalin contains Albuterol which is a bronchodilator and needs to be given if the child has wheezing. It can best be delivered by nebulization, but syrup is another alternative.", "Question: Dear Dr. Matthew MintzI have a very sore tongue.

My period has always been 28 days and this is the first time after we planned for baby\nAnswer: Hi I think you should take this medicine. This Austen is generally given to support the pregnancy and also to induce the period if the periods get delayed. What you can do is to repeat a urine pregnancy test after 1 week. She.

I referred several doctors they said it is because of some allergy but cannot be diagnosed, they prescribed me with cetrizine tablets, I am taking it for nearly 10 years so became addict to those tablets.  so please help me to come out of my disease and tablet addicting problems...........\nAnswer: Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. I would like to ask you about your symptoms in great detail, like - what are the activities that precipitate itching & rashes, whether they occur without any activity as well, whether you have any other medical conditions, whether you are taking any other medicines on regular basis, whether you have any other allergies, etc. etc. However, from your history, I would first think of what we call \"Cholinergic urticaria\". It is not exactly due to \"allergy\", rather it is due to some physical factors which causes rashes and itching. Were I treating you, I would suggest you as follows:1. Please avoid exercises and activities causing excessive sweating, if possible.2. Please avoid bathing in hot water, sauna baths, exposure to hot temperatures, etc. However, if any of these does not cause you symptoms, you can continue with it.3. I would suggest you to avoid hot beverages, alcohol and hot-spicy foods as much as possible.4. If you are having mental/emotional stress, I would suggest you regular meditation and stress reduction techniques as it also can be aggravating your symptoms.5. If you are not comfortable with cetirizine, I would personally suggest you to take ketotifen, which works better for these types of urticaria.6. Please do not scratch when you itch, it will only aggravate itching. You can apply lotion on itchy areas. An important thing I want to mention here is please do not think of \"addiction\" of antihistamines. These types of urticaria usually last for several years. So as long as you have symptoms, you need to take antihistamines like cetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor.

We have had a couple of miscarriages I m not sure if it is me because I have had one before him but Iconstantly worry about him. We have talked about it and he becomes hard randomly. He becomes hard even when he isn t aroused. Also after we have sex and he has cum he continues to stay hard. He tells me not to worry but I do. Does he need to see a doctor about this?\nAnswer: Hallow Dear, At the outset, let me assure you that frequent erecting dos not cause abortions nor does it affect conception. Erection is possible without sexual arousal (libido) even with tight underclothes or position. If you find him still erected even after ejaculation, you may not terminate the intercourse; continue to have the penis still in the vagina. After some time you will again start getting orgasm, this time within the vagina from what is called as G point. This is called as vaginal orgasm which hardly less than 10% of the women experience in their life. Continue the intercourse in the second innings and enjoy your vaginal orgasm. I do not feel he needs a medical intervention for his frequent erection and libido. Just cooperate with him. I hope this convinces you. ", "Question: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The blood colour is always pure red, just like the blood you get when you have a cut. As indicated, this happens once a while and sometimes 60 days can elapse without this experience. The last time I had it, I started the day taking porridge and sweetening it with some honey . In the afternoon after lunch I took a drink of Lucozade (energy sugar laden drink) and just before bed I eat a lot of sweet water melon. This condition has been with me for years. I am 64 years and one doctor said it could be due to piles or hemorrhoids . another assured me that since the blood was pure red it was unlikely that I have cancer . I will be going for further checks but in the mean time what do you think. Thanks\nAnswer: Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your condition is called rectal bleeding/hematochezia. This bleeding can happen if there is any bleeding in the intestinal tract. Since you say the color is bright, it is possible there is internal bleeding towards the lower intestinal tract i.e. rectum or anus. But, you should also be concerned if there is possible cancerous cells. In regard to diet, I am glad you have noticed that sweets do not work well with you. It may be because your Gastrointestinal tract is sensitive towards sugars and hence may be the resultant bleeding. Since you know it well, avoid sweets and foods that irritate the digestive tract such as fatty foods, heavy pastas, etc. Please consult a doctor as soon as possible.

Please advise.\nAnswer: Hi, If your elderly parent is having problems with the glaucoma medication, his/her ophthalmologist is the only one who can decide in changing medications and their dose according to the current health situation of the patient. If you are worried about the price, you can discuss with your parent doctor about the possibility of disbursement.

Thank you for posting here.toothache can radiate to the neck, face, head and neck. Do not panic. This will reduce once the treatment is done for the infected tooth. Get an x-ray taken in the infected tooth. Take a course of amoxicillin 500 and metronidazole to subside the infection. However, complete elimination of the infection requires a treatment like extraction or root canal in the infected tooth. I suggest you to get treatment done immediately to prevent any further progression of infection. Take retool 10 mg D. T for 3 days. This will take care of your pain. Disperse this in a glass of water and Chat Doctor. This cannot be related to hypothyroidism.

She has had her blood and urine checked for any abnormalities and everything checked fine.  The docs cant seem to figure out what is wrong with her.

In my opinion she should get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out obstructive airway pathology because this can cause similar symptoms.

Fertomid is given to women with PCs, but they are unlikely to work if you don't have any period. Moreover, they have to be started from the second day of period and continued for 5 days, but since you are not getting your periods, you will not be able to use them. You need to get your AMH levels done which will tell about your ovarian function. The most likely way for you to conceive now, is by considering IVF (test tube baby). The result of AMH will determine if you can use your eggs or donor eggs may have to used. Please consult a fertility specialist to decide the next steps. Hope this helps.

The treatment is long term use of nasal corticosteroids plus or minus oral antihistamines (although of limited benefit). The nasal corticosteroid recommended is mometasone furnace 1 spray per nostril once daily (start with twice daily for a month).

In case if the lump does not regress in a month consult a General Physician and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

Hurts a little, but I get my range of motion back. In addition, after sitting for maybe a short as an hour, deep inside my pelvic region on both sides will pop as I flex/tighten my muscles to sit up prior to standing.I fear that I may have a fractured hip tho I guess it could be mis aligned. But its the deep pelvic poping that has me concerned. I can only find references similar to what I feel as things a woman feels during pregnancy. And I assure you, I am not pregnant :-). All of my joints are becomeing easier to crack, as if I live a stress free life ( which I doubt ) and my muscles around my joints seems to have relaxed inadvertently to the point that a slight movement on my part causes them to pop. Most disturbing of all is that I can pop my sternum by taking a deep breath stretching my shoulders back.Is this some kind of arthritis disease? Could my body be releasing relaxin uncontrollably for no reason? Some joints are painful like my knees and shoulders and hip, and others are not, like my ankles,wrists, elbows, lower and middle back and my sternum is pain free.  thanks\nAnswer: Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Noted you have mainly pain at hip joint. Yes if you are overweight then arthritis might lead pain.... With advancing age and if calcium deficiency then osteoporosis like change might lead such presentation... For these condition to rule out x-ray of hip joint done.....

I have now seriously resolved to put an end to this habit. I am interested to know the following things 1. Should i clean my teeth by going to a dentist or should I be using some whitening paste? If the latter is suggested what is the paste that I should use.2. I am being made to understand that I would have by now lost the strength of my teeth.Is there any way to regain the same. I am taking SUpracal regularly. Please advise me.\nAnswer: Hello:)Congratulations on your resolution to Quit tobacco. The stains caused by pan chewing cannot be removed at home. So, I suggest you to get a professional cleaning done with the dentist. You can use any opaque toothpaste(transparent like closeup is not recommended) in pea sized amount with a medium or soft tooth brush. Professional cleaning will remove the irritants and stains on your teeth. Ask your dentist if you require a root planning treatment(if your gums are too weak). Use warm salt water rinse twice daily.

In very early stage no any specific symptoms are seen. Fever and weight loss can be there. Later on difficulty in urination, bleeding from urethra can be seen.

Therefore, I am mailing/ attaching  his medical reports, from SGPIMS, Lucknow, India,  for your kind observation & comments. Only after your observations, I will be able to decide the path ahead and further communication with you. Kindly mail me your observations at  YYYY@YYYY . Also pl tell me the tentative cost for treatment in your hospital\nAnswer: Hi there, Im sorry but this is a very non-specific question. It certainly depends on what the liver disease is.  If the liver disease is hepatitis A, this is self limiting and will resolve on their own. Antiviral medications can be used to treat hepatitis B and C, and newer agents for hepatitis C have proven to have great success.  If the patient has cirrhosis or liver cancer and this is advanced, then the only cure is a liver transplant.  In cases of liver cancer, sometimes the cancer can be removed safely, but this requires someone with expertise in the area. I don't know of any experts in your area, but I'd recommend seeking care a university hospital or one of the affiliates associated with them, as they likely have specialists experienced in this sort of cases.

Echocardiogram came back clean. chest xray the same. it was found that the right side of my heart was slightly enlarged, No ephsophogus problems found. Bone scan bothing Doctor says it is in my head and told me to wait a few months and he will check again.\nAnswer: Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry about. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that typical heart pains have some characteristics. They are usually retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. They may irradiate to both arms, neck and jaw. Furthermore, they last from 5 to 20 minutes. Pains that last all night are not typical heart pains. The first and most important thing is to exclude ischemic heart disease. The fact that you already have done echo and its normal it's a very good thing. If I was your treating doctor I would recommend a street test to definitely exclude ischemic heart disease. The fact that you have excluded any skeleton problem is also a good thing. The other thing to exclude is a gastrointestinal problem that sometimes are responsible for this kind of pains. So, I would recommend a fibrogastroscopi. After excluding this we can be sure that's nothing to worry about. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor.

It is customary and justified to give morphine to terminally ill cancer patients as cancer related pain is generally not amenable to any other form of therapy.

It was a traumatic experience as the surgeon (prior to the op) decided I needed a bag as my bowels had burst (which they had not).  Thanks\nAnswer: Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. What you're presently experiencing similar to the bowel gas formation.2. The excess weight you have gained with the fat layer over your tummy could be because of operation you might have not been physically active, and not moving the operative area and things like that.3. Yes workout is good - but don't do as you have planned, do it gradually with a brisk walk 30 - 45 min and then go on, as you gradually increase.4. Get an examination of the abdomen done by your doctor when ever you get appointment and then get an ultrasound abdomen done - which will rule out the lump which you are thinking of.5.

Hes otherwise really well, gaining weight, happy, playful and excellent appetite. He had a stool taken last week whicChatDoctore back all clear for any infections etc. The GP is not too concerned as he is happy and well. I have cut out cows milk and yogurts which seemed to make a slight difference. the runny/loose stools are not every time he has a bowel movement, but are quite regular and always sour smelling. Also hes been cutting his back teeth and now his incissors for past couple of months, could it just be because hes teething?Thank you in advance\nAnswer: I have gone through the details. Let me assure you that for a child of this age, passing stool a few times a day of somewhat loose consistency is absolutely normal, and you need not worry about it. Since the child is otherwise healthy, playful and gaining weight steadily, you need not be concerned. That is the reason your GP was not concerned. You have done a good thing by removing the milk from diet as it is optional anyway, but please include curd or yogurt as it is beneficial. Curd contains beneficial bacteria which will help in reducing the other bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for the foul smelling stools. Since the stool examination is otherwise ok, you need not worry about that too. However, you need not think that the stool odor would grossly improve. You need not worry about the grinding of teeth. It is normal too.", "Question: Hi My 7 and half month baby is having fever 101 from the day before yesterday. Started medomol drops 1.2 ml once in 6 hours.

This can at times cause severe pain and colic, and therefore I suggest you get at least an X-ray taken and an ultrasound of your kidneys to find out if the stone has indeed disappeared from the kidney and ureter. If the stones are in the ureter and are stuck causing you severe pain, a stent might be required to be placed to relieve you of the discomfort. Sometimes some Chat Doctor.

Like a bruised pain.  Dentist re examined.  All tissue around tooth very healthy and all looking good.  However bruised  pain  continues,  it is a front tooth.  Any sugguestions please. And thank u\nAnswer: Hi. Thanks for the query. As per your complaint bruised pain in your front tooth after a traumatic injury seems to be most probably due to fractures or cracked tooth. At times the tissues over the tooth seems to be health, but there are fine cracks or fractures in the tooth post injury that can be the cause of pain. Such cracks can be ruled out in x-rays by expert dentists or Endodontists. So my suggestion to you is to get an x-ray of the tooth done to rule out the exact cause of the pain and in case of cracks in roots of the tooth, the best way is to get the tooth removed followed by placement of artificial tooth in the form of either a bridge or an implant. As of now you can take Ibuprofen or Naproxen for pain. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

When I looked up my urine, blood results and the ultrasound results, it shows normal except: the gallbladder wall thickness is 3.5 mm (which they say in report is normal - but online, says that is high) pH 5.5 A/G Ratio - .8 (it says below low normal) MCH - 32.5 (it says above high normal) Neut% - 68 ALP - 104 MDX% - 9 I have had gallbladder attacks since 1994 - but never any gallstones. I have also been diagnosed with asthma , fibromyalgia and Crohns (though I am overweight ). I had stopped going to the emergency room because the answer is always the same - no gall stones, so go home, don t eat fatty foods. I went to the ER last night bc I have had constant pain and flare ups daily since Oct 25, and now the pain never goes away (under right rib cage, middle of rib cage, back under shoulder blade), chills, dizziness , nausea. My GI dr told me that I should ask for the test which shows how much bile is going in/out of the gallbladder, but of course, they did not - they did an ultrasound as usual - and surprise (not) - no gall stones, follow up with GI dr. - I feel that I am in need of immediate surgery. What do you think? Some things which would indicate possible infection or other disorders are on the high side of normal: This morning - once again - dizzy, pain in the same places, getting worse in middle abdomen\nAnswer: Hello! Thank you for the query. As surgery is a very serious procedure it needs some indications to have it performed. Your symptoms might be caused by gallbladder inflammation without gallstones (this is very rare) but it can also be caused by peptic ulcer, severe pancreas disease or even heart problems (including heart attack). That is why before any surgery you should have abdominal CT (to make sure the problem is not pancreas), liver tests (AST, ALT,GTP, AP - if last two elevated ERCP should be performed), bilirubin level, amylase and lipase level, urinalysis. Heart ECG and heart enzymes should be performed as well (CK-MB, Troponin) to see if there is any ischemia. As you do suffer from asthma, and it very often is associated with gastric reflux disease you should also have upper GI performed to see if there is no peptic ulcers or duodenum swelling. Only after all this tests if no other reasons of your symptoms you may start thinking about surgery. Hope this will help.

Now she is diagnosed with TC 15800 Cells/cmm & WIDAL (SLIDE METHOD) as POSITIVE. Is there anything to worry about???\nAnswer: Hi...coming to your queries first - 1. Tidal by slide method is a useless test - do not trust it.2. Tidal need not be done unless there is fever continuously for more than 7 days.3. This seems like a recurrent viral illness to me. I will explain to you what a viral illness is - so that you will be more confident next time. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

If your cough has returned then most probably you are not responding to the antibiotic treatment as expected. You will need to change the antibiotics prescribed. I suggest you undergo a culture sensitivity of sputum and get appropriate antibiotics based on that test. You might have to take a bucolic which will soften the phlegm and help in reduction of cough. If your cough does not reduce even after 5 days of antibiotics, then you need to get a chest X-ray to rule out tubercular focus.

I use a digital temporal thermometer would that be accurate and should I take her to the ER?\nAnswer: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Could be a reactivated chronic boil, due to the trauma with early mild edematous induration stage with fibrous walling around, Any other tissue as fat/collagen tissue could cause such a tumor.

Teachers and children are getting very sick. We are experiencing asthma, shortness of breathe, coughing, rashes and many other symptoms. Where in Maryland can we go to be tested for mold in our bodies beside an allergy doctor.\nAnswer: Thanks for the question. Asthma and related symptoms can certainly be very uncomfortable. You rightly recognize mold as an asthmatic trigger, something that irritates the lungs when inhaled and causes asthma attacks. Fortunately, the amount of mold that is inhaled is very small, and there is no need to have any kind of testing for mold in your body. On very rare occasions, people who are immunocompromised can get fungal infections in the lung, or a specific chronic fungal irritation known as Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergilli (APA), but these are rare and very likely not relevant here. If you are especially concerned, you can visit your primary care doctor for further diagnosis and treatment. For now, my only recommendation is to stay away from that mold!

I see a surgeon next week just preparing myself\nAnswer: I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. Unfortunately fusion while it may improve the symptoms on that level doesn't help with other levels, it can even accelerate their damage because the reduced mobility in L5-S1 after the fusion adds the strain on L4-L5. Hence, it is not to be surprised to have protrusion on L4-L5 with displacement of L5 root. It does justify your symptoms, although to be sure about that an exam is needed (reflexes, muscle weakness, numbness location) to confirm symptoms correspond to that root and not to remains of old problem.

Is this normal to just take it out could we not wait until it falls out itself. thanks gemma\nAnswer: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The abscess could be because of the tooth infection or gum infection. Consult an oral physician and get a radiograph done the rule out the infection and check the amount of supporting bone. If the bone support is not good then the tooth has to go for extraction. If there is sufficient one support then the tooth can be saved by doing RCT and curettage. The tooth will fall by its own once it becomes very weak. But if it gets infected then it can result in pain, swelling and other complications. So better to get it treated.

It does not hurt but it sticks out of the surface of the skin and I can feel the bump from the outside. It looks like a small bruise now as it turned brown over the months. I went to see my doctor and the doctor told me not to worry because it was a benign lump. I wanted  your opinion because I feel like the doctor was rushing and did not spend to much time inspecting the lump. Thank you,I will await your reply\nAnswer: Hello! Thank you for the query. It is very hard to tell not seeing it. Generally if it's not a mole, most likely it's a benign lesion (from your description it sounds like a fibrous). Skin lesions (which are not mole like) are mostly benign, and even skin malignant lesion (skin cancer) is nothing to worry about as it acts like a benign lesion (skin cancer rarely gives metastases). The best you can do is to consult dermatologist, have it removed and checked under a microscope. Hope this will help.
